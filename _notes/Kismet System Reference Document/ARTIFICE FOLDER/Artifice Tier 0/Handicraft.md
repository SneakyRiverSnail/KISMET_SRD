# [[7 ABILITIES]] -> [[ARTIFICE]]

# ***Handicraft <sup>ART</sup> (Minor Action, Common)*** 

You are skilled at fixing and making physical repairs. You also gain Proficiency with tools commonly associated with fixing and repairing (such as hammers, nails, calipers, etc..). As a Minor Action you can quickly repair an object you are holding or can touch in combat, without being Open, restoring one Hit to the Hit Threshold of the object. You cannot repair an object that is already broken (an object with 0 Hit Threshold is considered broken).
