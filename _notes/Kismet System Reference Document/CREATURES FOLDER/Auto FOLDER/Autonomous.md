# [[12 Creatures & Creature Cards|CREATURES]] -> [[AUTONOMOUS]]

 Autonomous creatures are fabricated or inorganic creatures. They range from automatons, robots, cyborgs, and any variety of mechanical power. Although autonomous creatures have as much range in purpose as they do material, they uniquely share that they are not organic creatures which provides as many benefits as it does drawbacks. While most of the Autonomous creatures in Amarant were originally manufactured in some way, the population is large enough and smart enough to begin to self sustain and create.

There are several kinds of Autonomous creatures including :

## ANDROIDS & ROBOTS (MINDLESS)

Many of the Autonomous creature in Amarant can claim some heritage or 	inspiration for there being from the original and most basic of technologies and robotics. While robotics and machines often started small such as the wheel, the steam engine, or even tools. The spread of technology and Autonomous creatures has only ever exponentially evolved into more magnificent and cutting edge technologies. Most Autonomous Creatures in this category started as functional supports for the Sentient races, Drones and security robots, robots that help with manual labor, or assist in specific fields and occupations. Once mass manufacturing of these types of robots became available, the breadth of their specific purposes grew and so too did their varying levels of intricacy, power, and in some cases sentience.  Descriptions of the Drones and Robots are listed below:

### AID, BUTLER, CUT, PROT., SURGE BOTS (MINDLESS)

These Robots, often called “Bots” in common vernacular, are named after a particular brand of Robotic manufacturers named “Bot. Co” who had a tendency to make all of their automatons into Androids, or humanoid shapes, with limited to great thinking capacity, and then label every one of them with “-Bot” or “O-Bot”. It quickly became popular slang to use -Bot at the end of an automaton and has stuck for many individuals and populations since. While Bot. Co.’s dynasty over all Autonomous Androids is small compared to what it once was, the cultural impact has left a long lasting impression. Almost all “Bots” are custom made starting only with a basic “skeleton” frame, and can take on a variety of appearances, though humanoid is the most common. Aid bots are used in health care and daily living assistance, although well made or “experienced” Bots can become full medical practitioners on their own. Butler Bots assist in daily living tasks but take on a homemaker role, having knowledge of recipes, cleaning, greetings, and hosting. These are generally the most expensive of the Bots given their wide range of functionality and breadth of information needed. Cut bots are mostly used in  manual labor, and while the term Cut Bot implies the bots are only used for cutting they can serve a variety of purposes such as cutting, bending, welding, molding, and any other form of manual labor. Prot. Bots, slang for Protection Bots, have a variety of forms as well. Some come in the form of exoskeletons or small shield generators that protect employees or  even the military from harm. Some are full Androids who assist in combat for mercenaries, and others are used as artificial intelligence systems for homes, being used for things like baby-proofing or burglar alarms. Surge bots are bots that were originally manufactured solely to help the ever growing demand for energy in increasingly Bot friendly homes. They take less forms than the other varieties of Bots, but their primary purpose is to charge, store, and give power to other bots or systems that may need it. Intelligence and ego vary amongst models, but since most “Bots” are manufactured by organic creatures, most opt for Bots to serve only their direct purpose and have just enough capacity to interact to different responses, they generally have no further ambition or insight. Bots, especially sophisticated Bots, mark a gray area in intelligence, having just enough intelligence to think creatively and problem solve, without having enough to challenge or separate from their main purposes. Most would make that this distinction in their design separates them from the “autonomous race”  and other “wild” Robots.

## AUTONOMOUS & CYBORG BEASTS

  

Beyond the most basic and primitive designs many robots and automatons were based around the life found in nature, honing the most useful aspects and removing unnecessary or limiting features. As such, many fabricators built robotics and Autonomous Creatures to match with almost every Beast one could find or think of. Some saw the potential to get the best of both the technological and natural world by replacing certain pieces of animals with cybernetic enhancements, or healing nature by replacing broken or injured parts with powerful cybernetics. This led to a growing population of robotic and cyborg Beasts, some used as pets, some used for labor or for security, and others roam the wilds just like their organic counterparts. 

  

Listed below are the most common and generic forms of both robotic and cyborg Beasts. This exists to give Weavers a guideline or even to use so that the Weaver can spend their creative energy elsewhere. Weavers are encouraged to apply the Robotc or Cyborg name and Abilities and apply them as they see fit to any creature in their games.

  

Note: for the Purposes of Kismet, Robotic refers to a creature that is entirely inorganic, whereas cyborg refers to an organic creature that has been enhanced by technology or cybernetics.
