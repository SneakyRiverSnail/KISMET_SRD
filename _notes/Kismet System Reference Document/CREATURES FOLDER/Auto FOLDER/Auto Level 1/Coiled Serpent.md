## Description: 

 a kind of “Wild” robot that roams Amarant. While the name Serpent can be misleading, Its name is a play on words as they appear often like serpents and snakes only made of wires, cables, and other loose ends. Coiled Serpents do in fact coil, like a snake would, however, and whether this is due to the natural bend of the materials it is made of, or a behavioral response, or both, is up for debate. There is no technical limit to the size of a Coiled Serpent, as their size can increase as they increase in “food” or scrap gained. However, unlike organic creatures since Coiled Serpents have no need to expend energy on the digesting of their food, they can grow quite large rapidly, and become a serious threat. Mostly Coiled Serpents are small nuisances to urban environments as they drain power from available sources in homes or in power plants. 

## Tactics/Disposition: 

Behaviorally, Coiled Serpents do act like Wild animals, seeking territory with power sources, mates with whom to exchange parts, and hunting “prey” which can be loose scraps to other Autonomous Creatures smaller than it. Coiled Serpents  tend to use a “bite” and “constrict” method of attack, similar to the snakes of the natural world. What drives these creatures to have such programming is not well understood, as it is with many Wild bots.
