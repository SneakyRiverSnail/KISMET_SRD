[[7 Abilities|Abilities]] are the special traits and powers that separate players from common peoples. They are the individual talents and learned skills that make a Character unique. Abilities are separated into two categories **COMMON ABILITIES**, which are the lowest level of power (Tier of Power 0). They represent everyday skills and knowledge that anyone can learn. And **HEROIC ABILITIES** that represent powerful displays of martial prowess, or spells, or actions that a heroic Character (like Player Characters) can perform. Heroic abilities are labelled in measures of power called [[2 CORE RULES#TIERS OF POWER|TIERS OF POWER]] from Tier 1 being the weakest, and Tier 5 being the most powerful (often abbreviated as T1, T2, T3, T4, and T5). Each player Character at [[2 CORE RULES#LEVEL|Level]], 1 starts with a certain number of Common and Heroic Abilities as shown on the chart below in the [[2 CORE RULES#LEVEL|LEVEL]] section. At every odd [[2 CORE RULES#LEVEL|Level]], past the first  [[2 CORE RULES#LEVEL|LEVEL]], a player Character earns a new  [[2 CORE RULES#TIERS OF POWER|Tiers of Power]] of [[7 ABILITIES|Abilities]] to choose from, as well as gains a new Common Ability to learn. When you learn a new Heroic Ability, you can choose to learn any ability of your current Tier of Power or lower, you may even choose to take a Common Ability instead of a Heroic Ability. When you gain a Common Ability, by reaching an odd [[2 CORE RULES#LEVEL|Level]] that Common Ability cannot be replaced with a Heroic Ability. For more information on abilities see the [[7 ABILIITIES|Abilities]] section
