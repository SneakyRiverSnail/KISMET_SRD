# EXPERIENCE, ENCOUNTERS, & DUNGEON BUILDING

## EXPERIENCE

Leveling up:  

When you reach a certain amount of experience points (by defeating monsters or completing quests or advancing the story) you reach the next [[2 CORE RULES#LEVEL|Level]]. If you reach this experience in the midst of combat, wait until the encounter is finished to [[2 CORE RULES#LEVEL|Level]] increases. Below is a chart showing how much experience is needed to get from one [[2 CORE RULES#LEVEL|Level]] to the next.  Necessary experience to [[2 CORE RULES#LEVEL|Level]] increases follows this chart:

### EXPERIENCE TOTALS TABLE
| LEVEL |                 EXP. Needed to reach next level                  |
|:-----:|:----------------------------------------------------------------:|
|   1   |                 All Characters start at level 1                  |
|   2   |           400 EXP needed to reach level 2 from level 1           |
|   3   |   900 EXP needed to reach level 3 from level 2 (total of 1300)   |
|   4   |  1600 EXP needed to reach level 4 from level 3 (total of 2900)   |
|   5   |  2500 EXP needed to reach level 5 from level 4 (total of 5400)   |
|   6   |  3600 EXP needed to reach level 6 from level 5 (total of 9000)   |
|   7   |  4900 EXP needed to reach level 7 from level 6 (total of 13900)  |
|   8   |  6400 EXP needed to reach level 8 from level 7 (total of 20300)  |
|   9   |  8100 EXP needed to reach level 9 from level 8 (total of 28400)  |
|  10   | 10000 EXP needed to reach level 10 from level 9 (total of 38400) |
 
Generally, defeating a monster gives the entire party the Creature's level times five in experience. For example a [[2 CORE RULES#LEVEL|Level]] 3 Creature gives 15 experience, the full experience is given to every party member or other contributors. However, to [[2 CORE RULES#LEVEL|Level]] increases solely by killing monsters is a slow and arduous process. Instead, Players are also awarded for Experience for completing quests. Quests can be large or small and are often the reason for adventuring. Quests related to the primary story of the overall campaign are called Main or Major quests. While the heroic ventures that happen outside of the main plot are called Side or Minor quests. Each give varying experience per [[2 CORE RULES#LEVEL|Level]] of the Characters in the party as followed by this chart below

###  EXPERIENCE POINTS FROM ADVENTURE ENCOUTNERS

Encounters can be harrowing experiences as well and are worth Experience Points. The more extreme the Adventure Encounter the more Experience Points will be awarded. Below is a table that will show you the progression of Experience Points earned per Difficulty of Adventure Encounter. Note that a Party does not gain Experience Points for an Adventure Encounter that has the Difficulty of “Extremely Easy”


## EXPERIENCE PER LEVEL TABLE

This chart, while useful for Weavers, is not mandatory. Weaver should feel free to adjust experience rewards as necessary to establish a story and world to their liking. The chart provided above, allows for the experience of Creatures to be accounted for. Experience from combat encounters are not accounted for when using the experience chart for quests above. This allows for a Weaver to have multiple encounters per [[2 CORE RULES#LEVEL|Level]].

## MAJOR QUESTS

Major Quests are turning points and climax’s in stories. Major Quests often has multiple goals and sequences in them, and can often change the direction of a story, or of an in-game society. A major quest could consist of going through several dungeon

temples to unlock a temple that holds a powerful boss monster inside. Or It could have the overarching goal of making two countries sign a peace agreement, but in order to do so, the Players must stop assassins, corrupt diplomats, and prevent civil unrest, before the treaty can be signed. Major Quests can have a huge impact on the course of the game. In the previous example, perhaps the Weaver has it set up so that should the Players fail to prevent any of the assassins, diplomats, or the civil unrest, the treaty

never gets signed and those two countries go to war, perhaps changing the course of the world’s history.

## MINOR QUESTS

Minor Quests are usually smaller and often appeal more to the party member’s personalities or desires. Often times, Minor Quests are rolled into the Major Quests, such as each sequence of the Major Quest. Other times Minor Quests are irrelevant to the Major Quest, such as the party hearing a rumor about a dragon hoarding vast amounts of treasure, or the party searching for a rare material to enhance one of the party member's swords. Sometimes Minor Quests are initiated by Players instead of Weavers. For example, a player that has a penchant for gambling may incur enough debt to have the gangs of the town start to look for them, perhaps the guard gets involved too. This does not mean however that every encounter the party engages in is a Minor Quest, Weavers are advised to use their best judgment. Minor Quests are the little adventures in between the legends that give the heroes of a party their Characteristics and myths.

## ENCOUNTERS

All Parties will eventually have to combat a group of enemies, When this happens the party has Entered Combat and begins an Encounter. Encounters are structured with Initiative and turns to resolve the combat. Encounters are created by setting a **Difficulty** and **Type**, both of which will determine how challenging a particular Encounter will be, as well as setting the **Features** and **Significance** which add Role Playing opportunities and meaningfulness to the Encounter. As a Weaver, it is your job to balance an Encounter so that it is difficult enough to challenge a party but not so difficult that it is impossible for them to prevail. Additionally, you will want to make the Encounter meaningful and engaging, the best way to do this is to include role playing hooks and consequences to the outcome of the combat (see Below, Encounter Significance).  
  
**Encounter Structure**

An Encounter begins with Initiative, which determines turn order with the highest score going first and the lowest score going last. Within each turn, Creatures take Actions and Move, when they are out of actions and movement their turn ends and they Draw initiative for the next round. Once all Creatures have completed their turn, the round is over and a new round begins using the new initiative order.   
  
**Encounter Difficulty**

A Weaver should attempt to balance an Encounter against a Party’s current strength. To do this a Weaver will want to add all the [[2 CORE RULES#LEVEL|Levels]] of the Party members, then set Creatures against them so that: 

  
  

·        An Easy Encounter has ½-¾ the number of [[2 CORE RULES#LEVEL|Levels]] a Party has, with no Creature being less than 2 [[2 CORE RULES#LEVEL|Levels]] below the party’s average level, and no Creature being more than 2 levels above the party’s average level. 

·        A Regular Encounter will have the same number of [[2 CORE RULES#LEVEL|Levels]] the Party has (3/4- the Same number of [[2 CORE RULES#LEVEL|Levels]]), with no Creature being less than 2 [[2 CORE RULES#LEVEL|Levels]] below the party’s average [[2 CORE RULES#LEVEL|Level]], and no Creature being more than 2 [[2 CORE RULES#LEVEL|Levels]] above the party’s average level. 

·        A Difficult Encounter has the 1¼ number of [[2 CORE RULES#LEVEL|Levels]] a Party has (The Same number of [[2 CORE RULES#LEVEL|Levels]] – 1 ¼ [[2 CORE RULES#LEVEL|Levels]]), with no Creature being less than 2 [[2 CORE RULES#LEVEL|Levels]] below the party’s average [[2 CORE RULES#LEVEL|Level]], and no Creature being more than 2 [[2 CORE RULES#LEVEL|Levels]] above the party’s average [[2 CORE RULES#LEVEL|Level]].  

·        A Deadly Encounter has 1 ½ the number of [[2 CORE RULES#LEVEL|Levels]] the party has (1 ¼ - 1 ½), with no Creature being less than 2[[2 CORE RULES#LEVEL|Levels]] below the party’s average [[2 CORE RULES#LEVEL|Level]], and no Creature being more than 2 [[2 CORE RULES#LEVEL|Levels]] above the party’s average level.  

For example, we will use a Party of 4 members that are each at [[2 CORE RULES#LEVEL|Level]] 6. By Adding each member's [[2 CORE RULES#LEVEL|Levels]] together, we get a total of 24 [[2 CORE RULES#LEVEL|Levels]]: 

  
  

-   An **Easy Encounter** for such a group would consist of multiple enemies whose total [[2 CORE RULES#LEVEL|Levels]] summed are 12 or more, but no more than 18 (½ to 3/4s of the total [[2 CORE RULES#LEVEL|Levels]] of the party), additionally, no Creature may be less than [[2 CORE RULES#LEVEL|Level]] 4 (party member’s average[[2 CORE RULES#LEVEL|Level]] 6, minus 2) and no Creature may be more than [[2 CORE RULES#LEVEL|Level]] 8 (party member’s average [[2 CORE RULES#LEVEL|Level]], 6,  plus 2). Any less than half of the total Party’s [[2 CORE RULES#LEVEL|Level]] is far too easy for an Encounter for a party, in the above example an Encounter with a total combined [[2 CORE RULES#LEVEL|Levels]] of 12 should be the lowest and easiest a Weaver should consider making an Encounter, but a Weaver could make it slightly more challenging to by increasing the number of [[2 CORE RULES#LEVEL|Levels]] of Creatures they pit against the Party up to 18. 

  
  

-   A **Regular Encounter** in this example, would be a number of [[2 CORE RULES#LEVEL|Levels]] equal to 24 but could be made easier by being in a range from 19-23 [[2 CORE RULES#LEVEL|Levels]] of Creatures with each Creature being between [[2 CORE RULES#LEVEL|Levels]] 4-8.

  
  

-    A **Difficult Encounter** is a number of [[2 CORE RULES#LEVEL|Levels]] equal to 30, but could be made easier by being in a range from 25-29 [[2 CORE RULES#LEVEL|Levels]] of Creatures with each Creature being between [[2 CORE RULES#LEVEL|Levels]] 4-8. 

  
  

-    A **Deadly Encounter** is a number of [[2 CORE RULES#LEVEL|Levels]] equal to 36, but could be made easier by being in a range from 31-35 [[2 CORE RULES#LEVEL|Levels]] of Creatures with each Creature being between [[2 CORE RULES#LEVEL|Levels]] 4-8. 

This mechanic serves only as a guideline to Weavers and should consider this when creating Encounters for their Players, but as always, it is the Weavers discretion that determines how difficult an Encounter should be. It is always important for Weavers to keep in mind that the Characters of Kismet, although heroic, are still mortal and the tides of battle can change in an instant. 

**Encounter Types** 

In addition to Encounter Difficulties, there are different types of Encounters. The three Encounter types of Kismet are Typical, Swarm, and Grim. Typical Encounters are more standardized and fair, often providing the same number or slightly more/less number of Creatures against the party. Swarm Encounters are when the party is heavily outnumbered and/or the Creatures have formed a Swarm (see below). Grim Encounters are encounters that include powerful enemies that are often well above the average [[2 CORE RULES#LEVEL|Level]] of the party but generally have fewer Creatures. 

**TYPICAL:** Typical Encounters are formed of any enemies but do not include Swarms (see Chapter 10: Combat Rules: Swarm Combat) nor Creatures that are 2 or more [[2 CORE RULES#LEVEL|Levels]] higher than any of the Party members. Typical Encounters are simple enough that they don't need much more though beyond setting an appropriate Encounter Difficulty and making the Encounter Meaningful.   

**SWARM:** Swarms are mass of several Creatures forced together in a mob. They act as a single Formation and only have one turn in the Initiative. For more information regarding Swarms see Chapter 10: Combat Rules: Swarm Combat for more information. The information is also presented here for the sake of convenience.

A Swarm is a minimum five Tiles of connected Creatures (although this number can decrease as the Swarm takes damage or chooses to separate) that cannot be separated by more than 1 tile from each other. Further, Swarms take on the statistics of the lowest [[2 CORE RULES#LEVEL|Level]] or lowest Statistic of the members of the Swarm for their Statistics block. Swarms have several traits to be aware of:

**Swarms Traits**

Swarms have several traits to be aware of in combat

o   The Swarm moves as one whole, but each Unit in the Formation can move on its own with the same Speed value as the Formation as a whole. However, individual Units cannot break apart from the swarm (be more that 1 tile away from another Unit of the Formation).

o   A Swarm itself has no Hit Points value, but each Unit of the Swarm has 5 Hit Points, Each time a Unit of a Swarm is reduced to 0 Hit Points remove that tile from the swarm and count it as defeated. If hit by an Area of Effect or a weapon that can hit more than one Unit (such as with the Cleave Property) Only the targeted Units take damage or are removed from the swarm.

o   A Swarm has only one Reaction each Round, but it can Always Attack an Opening without using its Reaction. In so meaning, a Swarm has an infinite number of times in a Round that it can Attack an Opening. 

o   A Swarm using an attack or ability that uses a Melee Attack Roll can always target every Creature in its Reach or Range with each of its attacks and abilities.

o   A Swarm can separate if individual Creatures deem it wise to do so. With a Minor Action an Allied Creature of the Swarm can join or separate from the Swarm.

o   A Swarm has access to any of the abilities of the individual Creatures that make up the Swarm, but still only has one Major, Minor, and Movement action as any individual Creature would in one Turn.

o   If a Unit of a Swarm becomes Restrained, Paralyzed, Stunned, has its Speed set to 0, or is otherwise unable to move it is automatically separated from its Swarm and becomes a single Tile swarm.

o   A Swarm interacts with a siege weapon, If it uses any Actions to operate the Siege Engine fulfills all of the number of Actions required to operate the Siege Engine.

o   For the purpose of assigning Experience Points, each Unit of a Swarm is worth 1 Experience Point per [[2 CORE RULES#LEVEL|Level]] of the Unit, such that a [[2 CORE RULES#LEVEL|Level]] 1 Swarm Unit is worth 1 Experience Point and a [[2 CORE RULES#LEVEL|Level]] 3 Unit is worth 3 Experience Points. Since a Formation is made of at least 5 Units, this is equivalent in Experience Points to a singular Creature of the same [[2 CORE RULES#LEVEL|Level]]. (remember that Experience Points = [[2 CORE RULES#LEVEL|Level]] times 5). 

 As for actually deciding how many Swarms for the Party to face in a particular Encounter, Weavers should choose between, 1, one half, or all of the Creatures in an Encounter to be a Swarm at their own discretion.

**GRIM:** Grim Encounters are like any other Encounter, but they include powerful enemies that are even as high as three [[2 CORE RULES#LEVEL|Levels]] above the Party’s [[2 CORE RULES#LEVEL|Level]]. Grim Encounters could include Swarms as well. As a rule of thumb, it is highly ill-advised to create an Encounter with more than half of the number of Party members as Grim or Creatures that are three [[2 CORE RULES#LEVEL|Levels]] (Or those in a Higher Tier of Power) than the party as these odds may be too overwhelming. In the above example a Party of four, [[2 CORE RULES#LEVEL|Level]] 6 Players, would have a total combined [[2 CORE RULES#LEVEL|Levels]] of 24, a Grim Encounter would include at least 1 of those adversaries being [[2 CORE RULES#LEVEL|Level]] 9 (3 [[2 CORE RULES#LEVEL|Levels]] higher than the Party’s members [[2 CORE RULES#LEVEL|Level]] of 6). In this scenario no more than 2 [[2 CORE RULES#LEVEL|Level]] 9 or Grim Creatures should be present, as it would likely be too overwhelming for Players (since 2 is half of 4, 4 being the total number of members present in the Party in the Encounter). It is not advised to present a Party with a Creature that is four [[2 CORE RULES#LEVEL|Levels]] higher than the Party’s [[2 CORE RULES#LEVEL|Level]], this is likely too overwhelming and most Parties will not be able to handle such a threat. 

**Encounter Features** 

The kind of adversary they face as well as the Circumstances the party faces during the Encounter are the core aspects of Encounter Features. As for actually deciding which specific adversaries to include in an Encounter, the Weaver is encouraged to use their discretion for what makes sense in the Environment the Party is in, and what relationships those adversaries may have. For example, The Party could be beset by bandits and while its likely the bandits may have a captain (a potentially Grim enemy) or even battle dogs to help them (potentially a swarm enemy) it would be unlikely for the city guard to aiding the bandits even if the [[2 CORE RULES#LEVEL|Level]] range were appropriate for the Encounter. Secondly, A Weaver should determine if the encounter needs a Circumstance (Chapter 9: Adventuring Rules: Circumstance Tarot) and if it does what type of Circumstance does the party fight these bandits in? Is there a storm? Perhaps they are in the bandit’s trapped lair. Choose at least one (but no more than three) Circumstances to apply to the combat that are the most appropriate.  For further inspiration Weavers can use the Circumstances and Circumstance Tarot (see Chapter 9: Adventuring Rules: Circumstance Tarot) to make an Encounter more exciting.

**Encounter Significance** 

It is important for Weavers to understand that while combat itself can be fun, combat with stakes, objectives and consequences are always better. Weavers can add significance to an Encounter by using a Circumstance and/or by adding **objectives and consequences**. For example, in the bandits example above, perhaps the bandits have hostages, meaning the players must try to save the hostages while defeating the bandits. On top of this, the bandits have taken to boats to escape the city, while you follow in your own boat. This gives players an objective and a consequence of failure and the Aquatic environment Circumstance. If in a scenario were creating both objectives and consequences are difficult to include, consider using multiple appropriate circumstances. In the bandit example above, if the hostages are saved by some friendly Sea Elves, leaving just the bandits to be captured, consider adding the Storm Circumstance in addition to the Aquatic Environment Circumstance to make the rest of the encounter more interesting. Caution should be used when adding more Circumstances as they can quickly become overwhelming and tedious to track, it's not recommended to ever use more than three Circumstances at a time. In the same manner, if it is difficult to add an appropriate circumstance, consider having more than 1 objective (but no more than 3). Perhaps one of the hostages is someone of great importance to the city? Or there is a time bomb planted in the town square and the Players must choose between saving hostages and defusing the bomb.  When enriching the Encounter, Weavers are only at the limit of their imagination and storytelling to make Encounters more daring. Below is a list of some example scenarios that can add Significance to the Combat.

As for actually deciding which specific adversaries to include in an Encounter, the Weaver is encouraged to use their discretion for what makes sense in the Environment the Party is in, and what relationships those adversaries may have. For example, The Party could be beset by bandits and while its likely the bandits may have a captain (a potentially Grim enemy) or even battle dogs to help them (potentially a swarm enemy) it would be unlikely for the city guard to aiding the bandits even if the [[2 CORE RULES#LEVEL|Level]] range were appropriate for the Encounter.  Weaver should also be sure to make sure they used a variety of Creatures or units to make encounters more exciting, for example and archer, a healer, and a warrior makes for a more interesting fight than simply three warriors who all use the same strategy.

## BETWEEN COMBAT

Roleplaying during social interactions and combat interactions can be really easy. However, it is often the case that roleplaying really comes to life during the in between moments. For example, the Party is walking towards the next town, what kinds of conversations might they have? Do they find anything of interest on their way? Do they remark about the weather they are having? Little details such as those help brings Characters to life. Also consider what your Character does during their down times. What do they do for leisure? read? Train? Volunteer at the orphanage? Or do they have a gambling problem? Think about what your Character's morality and goals are when choosing leisure activities for them.

## DUNGEONS

Throughout a Party’s adventures through Amarant, they will encounter ancient ruins, keeps, and challenging gauntlets, hidden with lay mighty treasures. Dungeons can come in a variety of shapes, sizes, difficulties, and even types. Dungeons are extremely varied, ranging from lairs of magical beasts, the well-guarded keeps of warlords, a rocky mountain climb,  or even a cave system. To aid Weavers when creating Dungeons or even just to have a basic layout simply to spark one’s imagination, you can refer to the text and tables below. 

The term “Dungeon” is used frequently throughout this section, it is imperative to understand, that while when one typically thinks of Dungeon, they think of great stone mazes filled with danger and treasure; However, in Kismet the term Dungeon does is not necessarily intended to only consist of that that. Dungeons should be thought of as any larger Encounter spaces, where multiple Encounters can occur and the Party must make its way through the space whether indoor, outdoor, underground, or even off planet. Dungeons usually hold great rewards but are challenging environments, and any setting that can fit into that description can be considered a Dungeon. Note that just like the Circumstances, not every Encounter needs to be a Circumstance and similarly not every Encounter space needs to be a Dungeon if the Weaver does not wish it so. 

Weavers can use Tarot Cards to build a Dungeon from scratch, (see rules below). Remember that even with this tool available to you, the Weaver has the liberty to modify or change aspects of the Dungeon during creation. The Tarot cards drawn are not hard rules but rather a guideline or inspiration to create a Dungeon. Creating a Dungeon is broken down into the following steps.

·              Choose a Dungeon Type

·              Choose a Dungeon Size

·              Draw Tarot for Dungeon Elements                                 

Weavers should always remember that while they can take everything they draw and see from the tables below to use in their campaigns, one should feel at liberty to put their own designs into whatever they pull from these tables, if you choose to even roll from the tables at all.

## DUNGEON TYPES

The Type of the Dungeon is the first thing one should consider when creating a dungeon. The type of dungeon is important, as it sets the theme, what types of Traps a party may encounter as well as what types of foes. Is your Dungeon a ruined castle? A Diseased Jungle? Perhaps your dungeon takes place in outer space, travelling from micro planet to micro planet to arrive at the center of the Universe. The Type of Dungeon you choose will help you determine appropriate friends, foes and various elements such as traps that complete the Dungeon experience. Choose at least one Type to start, if necessary, you can add as many types as you deem appropriate.

**Aquatic** – these dungeons consist of being on the high seas, underwater caves and cities, or even cavernous expeditions both under water and in air filled caves beneath the surface of the water.

**Plains**- dungeons in the plains consist of areas of preserve, magical Creature territory, battlefields with multiple objectives, or chase sequences from wild animals or plainsmen. Plains also serve as good environments on which to build massive keeps and fortresses which the party may need to invade or sneak into.

**Forest**- Forest dungeons are often the territories of nymphs, elves and other woodland magical beasts and persons. Forests also serve as the territories and lairs of woodland magical beasts such as certain dragons and unicorns. Forests like plains make excellent battlefields and give great chase or hunted sequences.

**Jungle**- Forest dungeons are filled with the wild danger of flora and fauna. The party being actively hunted by beast or person, ancient lost ruins, deadly hunting Traps and ancient Traps to ward off intruders.

**Desert**- these deadly environments are often half the battle of the dungeon. Environmental hazards and deadly beasts roam these unforgiving landscapes. Desert dungeons can be surviving in a large expanse of desert while staving off the native wildlife and persons, or even the lost ruins of an ancient civilization.

**Tundra-** like the desert, surviving the elements is half the battle with these frozen wastelands.  Dungeons often consist of surviving the open elements or exploring the deep cavernous ice.

**Chthonic**- Chthonic dungeons are the subterranean that lurks beneath the feat of the surface of Gaia. Dwarves, bantam, and a variety of species have cultural variants that live underground. However, they share the space with aberrant and horrific Creatures such as giant insects, and cruel subterranean cultures. Chthonic dungeons can be survival dungeons but often consist more of frightening gauntlets of cavernous darkness and exploring the unknown depths.

**Mountainous**- These dungeons consist of highlands and great peaks whose zeniths break the clouds. These environments are often home to powerful Creatures like dragons, giants, and griffons. Often, the climb of the mountain poses a threat to the party, while simultaneously dealing with the Creatures that wish to pick them off the face of the mountain and have them plummet to their death. Mountainous dungeons can also be substituted for skyscraping towers or similar excursions.

**Urban**- urban dungeons consist of cityscapes, secret tunnels, criminal dens, or even simply through the streets of various districts of the city. Urban dungeons are likely to have rogues, bandits, criminals, and a large element of social interaction.

**Extra-Planetary**- While extra-planetary travel is general reserved for the most Legendary and thrilling adventures, venturing far beyond the scope the races of Gaia perceive and understand.; nothing prevents even a low-level excursion of extra-planetary travel to give the party goals or set up plot points. Generally, these dungeons consist literally of other worldly Creatures such as elementals, or even upwards of divine and cosmic entities. Depending on the nature of the planet, there could very well be a survival element to these dungeons, but one is just as likely to come across another civilized and temperate culture.

## DUNGEON SIZE

The size  and type of the Dungeon should be considered next when creating a Dungeon. There are 5 sizes of dungeon’s, 1 being the smallest and 5 being the largest. The size of a Dungeon will determine the number of rooms/spaces a Dungeon has as well as the physical size of each room/space. Each Size of room has 5 plus or minus 2 rooms as Weavers see fit. Thus a Size 1 Dungeon has anywhere from 3-7 rooms or shapes, with a base number of 5 rooms or shapes. The Weaver is at their discretion to decide how many rooms or shapes a Dungeon has although 5 per Dungeon Size is a good reference for Weavers.  For example, a Size 5 Dungeon would consist of 25 rooms or shapes. In this instance, Size 5 does not refer to the Size of the Creatures inside of the Dungeon but rather that size of the challenge as the larger the Size of the Dungeon the more Encounters and traps the Party is likely to endure.

Another important factor for Dungeon Sizes is time spent playing them, as large Dungeons take more time to get through many groups may find exceedingly long Dungeons boring and tedious. Weavers are encouraged to use their discretion of their groups likes and dislikes to determine an appropriate Dungeon Size, Typically Dungeon size 2 or 3 (10 or 15 rooms respectively) is sufficient.   Regardless of Size or Type, Dungeons are challenging for parties to overcome and Weavers should be cautious not to overwhelm their Party too frequently, otherwise the task before them can seem impossible.

Weavers should also consider size and type of the Dungeon based on how many Experience Points they want their Players to earn for the Dungeon. If the Dungeon is part of a Major Quest, or is a Major Quest in and of itself, consider making the Dungeon slightly more challenging and bigger, allowing for more Encounters. For Dungeons that are part of or are Minor Quests, it is preferable to make them slightly challenging but easily managed by the Party. To determine this, look to the Encounter building section above (Chapter 11: Experience, Encounters, & Dungeon Building) to determine what is a more fair representation of the difficulty of Encounters. In the subsequent tables, you will see options to help the Weaver start creating a Dungeon. As the tables are randomly pulled there are options which seem odd at first glance. It is always the Weaver’s discretion to use or not use such options, similarly a Weaver may simply take inspiration from these tables and adjust as creatively as they like. For example, even options like these are still useful for Weavers who wish to introduce the party to a difficult Encounter but do not wish to have the party trek through miles of Dungeon before finding the pivotal encounter. That is, should the Weaver choose to use these tables at all.

Weavers should consider the type and size of the Dungeon when determining the height of the Dungeon.  Is it the narrow tunnels of subterranean horrors? The tall looming halls of an elegant castle, nothing but the infinite sky above their heads? For this reason, height is mostly un-included in the dimensions and values mentioned below. Weavers should use common judgment or even realistic examples to determine the height of individual rooms or spaces throughout the dungeon

## DUNGEON ELEMENTS TABLES

 Below will be a number of tables used to determine the elements of a room in a Dungeon. To do so simply draw four cards from the Tarot Deck per room of the Dungeon you are creating. In order they will determine the Shape, Doors, Traps, and Encounters of each particular room or shape of a Dungeon. Do this for each next section of the Dungeon until the Deck has run out. This should be around 5 rooms/shapes for a Dungeon or essentially a Size 1 Dungeon. Shuffle the deck and keep repeating this process for each Size of Dungeon one would like.  Below these tables you will see more tables referring to which Specific traps one may see in the Dungeon, reshuffle the deck or continue drawing as you like to determine specific Traps the Party may encounter. The last section labeled DIFFICULTY should be drawn after all other elements have been drawn. Reshuffle the deck and draw one card for each Door (that requires it) and for each Trap to determine the DL for them. This should give a truly randomized Dungeon with variable elements that is different every time one draws from these tables. As Weavers gain experience in crafting Dungeons for their Parties they may find themselves no longer needing these tables, but they may always be useful for inspiration or just creating a starting point if you so wish.  The tables results are explained in the sections after the tables.

## DUNGEON TYPES

The type of dungeon is important, as it sets the theme, what types of Traps a party may encounter as well as what types of foes.

**Aquatic** – these dungeons consist of being on the high seas, underwater caves and cities, or even cavernous expeditions both under water and in air filled caves beneath the surface of the water.

**Plains**- dungeons in the plains consist of areas of preserve, magical Creature territory, battlefields with multiple objectives, or chase sequences from wild animals or plainsmen. Plains also serve as good environments on which to build massive keeps and fortresses which the party may need to invade or sneak into.

**Forest**- Forest dungeons are often the territories of nymphs, elves and other woodland magical beasts and persons. Forests also serve as the territories and lairs of woodland magical beasts such as certain dragons and unicorns. Forests like plains make excellent battlefields, and give great chase or hunted sequences.

**Jungle**- Forest dungeons are filled with the wild danger of flora and fauna. The party being actively hunted by beast or person, ancient lost ruins, deadly hunting Traps and ancient Traps to ward off intruders.

**Desert**- these deadly environments are often half the battle of the dungeon. Environmental hazards and deadly beasts roam these unforgiving landscapes. Desert dungeons can be surviving in a large expanse of desert while staving off the native wild life and persons, or even the lost ruins of an ancient civilization.

**Tundra-** like the desert, surviving the elements is half the battle with these frozen wastelands.  Dungeons often consist of surviving the open elements or exploring the deep cavernous ice.

**Chthonic**- Chthonic dungeons are the subterranean that lurks beneath the feat of the surface of Gaia. Dwarves, bantam, and a variety of species have cultural variants that live underground. However, they share the space with aberrant and horrific Creatures such as giant insects, and cruel subterranean cultures. Chthonic dungeons can be survival dungeons but often consist more of frightening gauntlets of cavernous darkness and exploring the unknown depths.

**Mountainous**- These dungeons consist of highlands and great peaks whose zeniths break the clouds. These environments are often home to powerful Creatures like dragons, giants, and griffons. Often, the climb of the mountain poses a threat to the party, while simultaneously dealing with the Creatures that wish to pick them off the face of the mountain and have them plummet to their death. Mountainous dungeons can also be substituted for skyscraping towers or similar excursions.

**Urban**- urban dungeons consist of cityscapes, secret tunnels, criminal dens, or even simply through the streets of various districts of the city. Urban dungeons are likely to have rogues, bandits, criminals, and a large element of social interaction.

**Extra-Planetary**- While extra-planetary travel is general reserved for the most Legendary and thrilling adventures, venturing far beyond the scope the races of Gaia perceive and understand.; nothing prevents even a low-level excursion of extra-planetary travel to give the party goals or set up plot points. Generally, these dungeons consist literally of other worldly Creatures such as elementals, or even upwards of divine and cosmic entities. Depending on the nature of the planet, there could very well be a survival element to these dungeons, but one is just as likely to come across another civilized and temperate culture.

## DUNGEON SIZE & SHAPES

To craft and construct dungeons, or basic dungeon models, refer to the table above to see how many and what shapes get randomly generated.  Because of the random generation, Weavers should feel at liberty to pick and choose from any size category or shapes they feel appropriate even if it conflicts with the original category. Weavers are also at creative liberty to connect shapes, and place doors in a manner that is most in line with their vision of the Dungeon.

Weavers should feel free to multiply the original Tile(s) Sizes provided by these tables. For example, the basic Tunnel is a 2x1 Tiles shape, however in a much larger Dungeon or a Dungeon with larger Creatures in it, simply keep the proportions and multiply to create a space large enough to fit your image. A Tunnel could be a 10x5 Tiles shape making a grand hallway for Size 1 Creatures, but a nearly tight squeeze for a singular Size 5 Creature for example.  

**Square**- a square is just that, a simply shaped room, although the room can consist of whatever the Weaver decides to put into it, enemies, Traps, doors etc.

**Tunnel**- tunnels can be just that, or hallways, or stretches of thinner land. Typically hallways are half as wide as they are long, but Weavers should always feel free to design them according to their own need, not following the base model if they do not wish to.

**T-shaped connector-** are usually found at the end of tunnels that give players the choice of two directions to continue.

*INSERT IMAGE*

**Four Way-** Four ways are intersections and often leave players with a choice of directions to come across. Describing the typical model of the four way as 3X3 is a bit of a misnomer, instead think of them as two perpendicular tunnels each 3 tiles long and 1 tile wide. The tunnels intersect or share their second tile in the sequence creating a format as such:

 *INSERT IMAGE*

**Right Angle**- right angles can be curves or changes of directions.  To describe a right angle as 2X2 is a bit of a misnomer, instead imagine that there are two line each 2 tiles long and 1 tile in width. Each intersects at their second tile creating a formatting like so:

*INSERT IMAGE*

**Fan**- fans are interesting rooms are larger on one end and smaller at the other, with the entrance typically being at the smaller end. Fans follow the same tile pattern as cone effects, the base model being 5 cone tile. Such that the largest part of the room is 5 tiles across, then 4, then 3, then 2, then a single tile at the entrance.

**Slope/Stairs down/up**- Slopes or stairs leading up or down. While a base model is given stating that stairs are typically 2 tile long, 1 tile wide and 1 tile in depth. Weavers should be feel most comfortable manipulating the size of their slopes and stairs and even the design. Is it a smooth or jagged steps? Steep with guarding rails? Or low rails that allows Creatures to be pushed off? These factors drastically change the shape and tile set of the stairs or slope in question, and Weavers should feel more than comfortable manipulating their stair dimensions.

**Pit/Circle**- Pits and circles are categorized as one because of their similar shape. However circular rooms are just that, and their tiles should be counted as if it

were the same as a burst area of effect. Pits are the same except for that they often immediately or gradually slope down into a deeper area. Pits and circles and be used to represent, holes, arenas, ballrooms or any other circular shaped room one can think of.

**Dead End**- Dead ends are just that, trick rooms or ending hallways.  Dead ends are perfect for Traps, secret rooms, mazes, and caches of treasure.  Dead ends should always be consistent with the dungeon layout and share similar dimensions the piece it is attached to.  Weavers should as always, regard the values as malleable, and Weavers may even want to manipulate the dimensions of a dead end to make it seem suspicious to players.

**Main Chamber**- main chambers are an umbrella term for large rooms. These can be treasure rooms, throne rooms, dining halls, or other rooms that need large space. Essentially they are larger than squares, and to differentiate a main chamber form a square a Weaver should make the main chamber larger than

that of whatever values your dungeon’s squares have. Despite the name, there is no reason that a dungeon of any kind cannot have multiple main chambers or even simply be one massive main chamber. Weavers should always feel free to express their imagination however they see fit.

**Spiral/Stairs –** Leading up or down these curvatures prevent vision from below or above. Whether stepped like starirs or smooth gradually curves spirals are a dangerous threshold and tight on space. The typical Spiral, shares the Dimensions of stairs above, 2x1x1 Tiles.

**Curve –** Similar too a Right angle, curves are often seen in more natural environments like caves and underwater reefs. Curves functions more or less identically to Right Angles but their signature curvatures may block vision.

**Rectangle -**  Like the Tunnel only larger, rectangles serve more as true rooms than they do connecting shapes. They are generally 4x3 Tiles.

**Barracks/Jail** – Sharing the Dimensions of a Main Chamber a barracks or Jail is a unique shape that includes many walls that can provide cover or block vision. At every other intersection of Tiles include a wall that is perpendicular to the connecting Tiles as one sees fit. Weavers should feel free to add as many or as little walls/cells as they like. Descriptions are powerful tools for Weavers, are the cells lined bars with hanging bunk beds? Sturdy beds with armaments above them? Are there no walls between the guard’s beds to prevent thievery? Setting the scene will greatly change the appearance and obstacles of this type of room.

**Closet –** A small nook in which can hold equipment and supplies, these small rooms are great for hiding peoples, things, and secrets. They are Typically 1x1 Tiles. 

**Fork -**  A Diagonal Fork Splits one hall into two others. In terms of Tiles think of the initial shape as a 3x2 tile cone, like a T-Shaped Connector such as:

*INSERT IMAGE*

**Slim Tunnel** **–** Like a Tunnel, however this Tunnel has proportions that intentionally force a Creature of appropriate Size for the environments to Squeeze through. (See Chapter 9: Adventuring Rules: Non-Standard Movement: Squeezing)

**Slim Four-Way -**  Like a Four-Way, however this Four-Way has proportions that intentionally force a Creature of appropriate Size for the environments to Squeeze through. (See Chapter 9: Adventuring Rules: Non-Standard Movement: Squeezing)

**Slim Right Angle –** Like a Right Angle, however this Right Angle has proportions that intentionally force a Creature of appropriate Size for the environments to Squeeze through. (See Chapter 9: Adventuring Rules: Non-Standard Movement: Squeezing)

**Slim Curve –** Like a Curve, however this Curve has proportions that intentionally force a Creature of appropriate Size for the environments to Squeeze through. (See Chapter 9: Adventuring Rules: Non-Standard Movement: Squeezing)

**Slim Fork –** Like a Fork, however this Fork has proportions that intentionally force a Creature of appropriate Size for the environments to Squeeze through. (See Chapter 9: Adventuring Rules: Non-Standard Movement: Squeezing)

**Slim Previous Room –** Take the last room or shape you have drawn and give it proportions of pathways that force a Creature to Squeeze. (See Chapter 9: Adventuring Rules: Non-Standard Movement: Squeezing)

## DOORS

Doors and other transitions are an integral part of dungeons. However, given the variety and scope of dungeon settings, choices of door should be thematic and appropriate to environment and theme. Weavers should feel free to be creative when it comes to doors. Perhaps replacing a few strong iron doors with a wrought iron portcullis, teasing what’s on the other side of it, a weak frail door on its last hinges while other doors around it are in pristine conditions leads to suspicion, or even creating a magical solid membrane for aquatic dungeons. Doors and transitions seem relatively simple, but symbolically they hold a lot of power, and a door with a unique design may pique the interest or arouse the suspicion of a party. Weavers are encouraged to be creative when it comes to transitional gates. Doors can have one or more properties including Open, Locked, Trapped, and Secret. For each property a door has that requires a DL, draw a separate Tarot on the Difficulty Table.

**Open -** Open doors are unlocked but not necessarily open such that a Player or Creature may see what is on the other side, although a slightly ajar door may pique curiosity in Players.

**Locked -**  Locked doors are closed and have a locking mechanism. Without the appropriate key to open the lock, Creatures wishing to enter the door must make an Equipment Skill Check with Thieves Tools to enter. Determine the DL of the Lock by drawing tarot in the Difficulty Table. If the door has multiple properties that require a DL, draw a separate Tarot on the Difficulty Table for each property.

**Trapped** - Trapped doors are doors that have a Trap, Disease, or Curse placed on intruders who do not have the keys or know how to bypass it. Each type of trap (Curse, Disease, Elemental, Physical, & Poison) has its own triggers and functions which you can see below in the Curses, Diseases, and Traps section of this Chapter. Each trap has two DL's, first a DL to detect that a trap is present and a DL to disable that Trap. Draw two tarot from the Difficulty Table to determine these values separately.  If the door has multiple properties that require a DL, draw a separate Tarot on the Difficulty Table for each property.

**Secret -**  Secret doors are hidden entrances that usually only the builders or current residents know about. Examples are cellar doors hidden under rugs, or moveable walls. Secret doors require an active Investigation Skill Roll to find, or can be found with a Creature or Players Passive Perception. Secret Doors may also need another Skill roll to determine how to activate the passage such as Investigation Skill Roll to find the lever or an Equipment Skill Roll to activate the mechanism. Whether or not a Secret Door has any additional functionalities or Skill Rolls associated with it should be entirely up to Weaver creativity. Determine the DL of finding the Secret Door by drawing tarot in the Difficulty Table. If the door has multiple properties that require a DL, draw a separate Tarot on the Difficulty Table for each property.

## DUNGEONS: TRAPS, CURSES, DISEASES, & POISONS

Dungeons are infamous for being ridden with Traps and dangers around every corner. Use the Traps Table above to determine what shapes or rooms contain Traps. With Traps, especially, Weavers should exercise judgment on how many Traps they think their party can handle, taking into account the party’s overall ability, to both finding and disarm Traps can greatly determine the difficulty of a Dungeon. Further, regardless of the Party’s Level, Traps are always life threatening or have severe consequences, throwing too many Traps could mean that one eventually breaks the Defenses of your Players. This being said, one shouldn’t be afraid to use Traps, even in abundance, but if a Weaver chooses to have a very Trap filled Dungeon, they can do their Players a favor by emphasizing descriptions and tales of terror of the Dungeon, that way Players may get the idea ahead of time that the Dungeon will be harrowing and that they should always be on guard. This can help to mitigate an overwhelming number of Traps by giving players clear and distinct warning before venturing in.

Traps of all kinds share certain properties shown here:

Traps are almost always for a Creature or Player to roll a Perception Defense Roll, if the Defense Roll of a trap is not stated assume it is Perception Defense. This simulates the Creature or Player observing the Trap or observing it long enough to avoid its consequences. The exception to this rule is Curses,which target Resolve Defense and Diseases & Poisons, which target Fortitude Defense. (For more information see Chapter 9: Adventuring Rules: Curses / Diseases & Poisons)

Traps of all kinds have a Trigger of some sort. Most often the Trigger is simply being close enough to the Trap to activate it. In most cases the actual Trigger for the Trap is negligible, although Curses are an important exception to this rule as the Trigger is often related to the nature of the Curse itself (see more in Curses, below). Examples of Triggers can be pressure plates, touching objects, opening or touching a door or door handle, trip wires, or magic that detects intruders or invaders, or those who failed to properly bypass the Trap. Weavers should feel free to creatively describe how their Players or a Creature Triggers a trap, for example: “ as you take a step forward you feel your foot slide lower into the ground and your heart sinks as you hear the tell tale Click* of a Trap”  or as you touch the door’s handle you feel an immediate and sharp prick on your finger, looking down you see droplets of blood forming on your finger”. 

Traps usually have some sort of bypass and usually this bypass is only relevant to describe how residents of the Dungeon do not activate their own traps that Players may be unaware of. Mostly the explanation of the residents who are familiar with their surroundings and are the ones who have laid the traps is enough to explain how residents do not Trigger their own Traps. That being said, a Weaver’s sense of creativity can create unique and fun instances, for example maybe a Player with a higher Passive Perception may notice that Creatures are thematically only stepping on certain Tiles, taking a quick skip to get over trip wires, or carry around a magic rune that lets them bypass their traps. Feel free to reward Players that take advantage of such a mechanic if you so choose to have them included. 

Traps do not “Surprise” the Creatures that they attempt to injure. That is to say the Creature or Player does not have the Surprised Condition from the Trap in a way that means the Trap has a Bonus Die on its Attack Value against a Player’s or Creature’s Perception Defense. Thematically a Trap is designed to catch a Creature off guard and the Creature would definitely be exasperated by a Trap, this is simply to say that a Trap does not receive a Bonus Die to its Attack Roll/Value.

Unless otherwise stated Traps will have an Area of Effect that is 1 Tile in Radius/line per Lethality Tier it possesses. This makes Traps not just deadly for those who encounter them but for those who may be accompanying them as well. Weavers should feel free to embellish the nature of traps if there is a thematic disconnect, perhaps a Poison needle prick on a doors handle is now a poisonous gas that floods in a Line Area of Effect, or a bladed scythe Trap is now large enough to has enough Cleave to effect multiple Creatures. Curses are an exception to this general ruling, as they are highly debilitating and have a very specific Trigger that may or may not already include an Area of Effect. However, Weavers are always at liberty to modify the obstacles and challenges in their game as they see fit. 

A Creature or Player that fails their appropriate Defense Roll against a Trap also receives a Wound (Only Elemental and Physical Traps will give Wounds, Curses, Diseases, and Poisons do not), and the Traps’ LTH Tier in Levels of Exhaustion simply for failing their Defense Roll. Any additional Exhaustion or Wounds that a Trap inflicts are added to this Initial Level of Exhaustion or level of exhaustion granted by a Wound. In For example an Exhausting Elemental Trap that is LTH Tier 2 would give 4 Levels of Exhaustion (2 from LTH 2, 1 from Exhausting, and 1 more from the Wound it will inflict). See Below in the Elemental Traps sections to understand this example in detail.

Traps should be thematic and appropriate for dungeons, however if you wish to randomly generate Trap types you may use the Trap Table above to determine the Types and number of Traps in a shape or room. To determine the Specific trap roll on the appropriate Dungeon Curses, Diseases, Elemental, Physical, and./or Poison Traps Tables respectively. 

### ELEMENTAL TRAPS

Gouts of white hot flame, Frigid blasts of ice, forks of lightning leap through the air. Elemental Traps are Traps that harness the power of Elemental Magic to directly harm intruders and trespassers. Elemental Traps are great obstacles for Weavers that wish to challenge the Party with direct Damage, Wounds, and larger Area of Effects, meaning that even though it only takes a single Creature to Trigger one, others may also be affected. If a Weaver wants to implement or draws an Elemental Trap on the Traps Table above, they can find a more specific Trap with the Elemental Trap Table, also above. Elemental Traps are found with an Investigation Skill Roll or with a high Passive Perception and Disabled with a Thieves or Trap tools Equipment Skill Roll. Players or Creatures who have Triggered an Elemental Trap must make a Perception Defense Roll to avoid the consequences of them. The Difficulty Level of both finding and disabling an Elemental Trap can be determined with the Difficulty Table above, or simply by the Weaver’s discretion. To determine the which Element the Elemental Trap uses, and therefore which Wound stems from that Damage Type, draw another Tarot to Determine the Element.

Elemental Traps specialize in Large Area of Effects and may be larger than the 1 Tile per LTH Tier that was suggested above, read the descriptions of the Elemental Traps below carefully to get their full effect.

Unless otherwise stated an Elemental Trap will deal its appropriate Damage Type and Deal its LTH Tier Damage (See Chapter 8: Equipment, Gear, & Economy: Consumables: Remedial & Lethality Tier for more information.)

Remember that a Creature or Player that fails their appropriate Defense Roll against a Trap also receives a Wound (Only Elemental and Physical Traps will give Wounds, Curses, Diseases, and Poisons do not), and the Traps’ LTH Tier in Levels of Exhaustion simply for failing their Defense Roll. Any additional Exhaustion or Wounds that a Trap inflicts are added to this Initial Level of Exhaustion or extra exhaustion gained by a Wound. 

Weavers should note that amongst the types of Elemental Traps are mixtures of several descriptors, such as “Ruining Line”, this combines two aspects to make a more deadly trap. A more detailed description of the Elemental Traps and their descriptors are found below.

**Line -**  Line Elemental Traps determine the Area of Effect of the Elemental Trap. For each LTH Tier a Line Trap has give the Trap 2 Tiles to the Line, such that LTH 1, which has a base DL of 7 (Tier of Power 1 = LTH 1 = DL 7), it is a 2 Tile Line from the origin Tile. In this same manner an LTH 3 line would be a 6 Tile Line from the origin.

**Cone -**  Cone Elemental Traps determine the Area of Effect of the Elemental Trap to be a Cone. For each LTH Tier a Cone Trap has give the Trap a 2 Tile Cone such that LTH 1, which has a base DL of 7 (Tier of Power 1 = LTH 1 = DL 7), it is a 2 Tile Cone from the origin. In this same manner a LTH 3 Cone would be a 6 Tile Cone from the origin TIle. Remember that a Cone is measured as X Tiles as a Line from the Origin, X Tiles at its widest, including the middle Tile, and X Tiles at the Diagonals. Such that a 2,3, & 4 Tile Cone look like:

*ISNERT IMAGES*

Observe that each cone is X Tiles, at its longest, at its widest (on each end, from the middle Tile) and on the diagonals.

**Radial -** Radial Elemental Traps determine the Area of Effect of the Elemental Trap to be a Radius. For each LTH Tier a Radial Trap has, give the Trap a 2 Tile Radius in every direction, including vertical directions. Such that LTH 1, is a 2 Tile around the origin Tile. For example, a LTH 3 Radial Elemental Trap has a 6 Tile radius around an Origin Tile.

**Large –** Large Elemental Traps double the Size in Tiles of the Elemental Trap. For example, the Base Radial Elemental Trap is 2 Tile in Radius per LTH Tier it has, a Large Radial Elemental Trap would be 4 Tiles in Radius per LTH Tier instead.  

**True Damage** – True Damage Elemental Traps ensure that the Trap’s Damage Value Changes from the base LTH Tier Damage (See Chapter 8: Equipment, Gear, & Economy: Consumables: Remedial & Lethality Tier for more information) into True Damage equal to Twice the value of the LTH Tier. This means that an LTH 1 True Damage Elemental Trap deals 2 True Damage and a LTH 3 Trap would deal 6 True Damage. Remember that True Damage ignores any and all Armor Value. True Damage is still affected by Resistance, and Vulnerability. If a Creature has Immunity to the True Damage Type, then it deals no damage.

**Exhausting** – Exhausting Elemental Traps always give Creatures that failed their Defense Roll against the Trap one Level of Exhaustion. This is in addition to any other effects of a Trap that might add a Level(s) of Exhaustion. An Exhausting Trap does not scale with LTH Tier, clever Weavers will notice that is very easy to reach or exceed 5 Levels of Exhaustion in a single instance of a Trap (enough to kill a Creature or Player) and are advised to use caution when adding this Descriptor. This is because Traps inherently grant a Level of Exhaustion per LTH Tier they, have and for any Traps that deal Wounds, deal an extra Level of Exhaustion.

**Ruining** – Ruining Elemental Traps always deal their LTH Tier in Hits against all currently equipped Weapons and Armors worn be the Creature(s) that failed their Defense Roll against the Trap. This is in addition to any other Hits a Trap may do such as from a Wound.

**Roil** – A Roil or a Roiling Elemental Trap leaves a hazardous Area of Effect that persist until removed. A Roil can be removed from an Ability, Skill Roll to disable the Trap or physically removed, although to do so may be dangerous to a Creature. Roils have a Radial Area of Effect, including the vertical axis, and the Radius is 2 Tiles per LTH Tier the Roil Elemental Trap possesses. Further, Roils are Rough Terrain and costs a Creature 2 Tiles of Speed for each Tile it wishes to move through the Roil. Examples of Roils are floors of hazardous material such as lava or acid, or even spikes or tendrils that lash out. Weaver’s may note that Roil Elemental Traps do not come with other descriptors such as Large, True Damage, Exhausting, or Ruining, this is because Roil Elemental Traps are inherently very dangerous by their nature. Weavers may choose to add another descriptor to a Roil Elemental Trap but should keep in mind that doing so makes an extremely deadly Trap.

**Storm –** a Storm Elemental Trap functions identically to a Roil Elemental Trap, except that the origin Tile of the Storm Elemental Trap attempts to follow the Creature(s) who Triggered them each Round it is not removed.  If multiple Creatures Triggered the Trap, it follows one of them at random. An individual Creature can only be Damaged / Roll a Perception Defense Roll against the Trap once per Round. The Storm Elemental Trap always moves last in the Initiative.  Weaver’s may note that Storm Elemental Traps do not come with other descriptors such as Large, True Damage, Exhausting, or Ruining, this is because Storms Elemental Traps are inherently very dangerous by their nature. Weavers may choose to add another descriptor to a Storm Elemental Trap but should keep in mind that doing so makes an extremely deadly Trap.

**Elemental Spawning** – An Elemental Spawning Trap summons its LTH Tier number and Tier of Power Elementals every round the Trap is not disabled. This Trap does not require a Defense Roll since it does not directly injure a Creature. An Elemental Spawning Trap does activate immediately upon being Triggered and spawns additional Elementals on its turn, which is always the last turn in the Initiative. As a quick reference for Weavers this means that for each LTH Tier an Elemental Spawning Trap possesses it summons that same number many Elementals of twice that numbers’ Level. For example, a LTH 1 Elemental Spawning Trap summons x1 Level 2 Elemental initially and at the End of each Round. A LTH 3 Elemental Spawning Trap would summon x3 Level 6 Elementals initially and at the End of each Round.  Weaver’s may note that Elemental Spawning Traps do not come with other descriptors such as Large, True Damage, Exhausting, or Ruining, this is because Elemental Spawning Traps are inherently very dangerous by their nature. Weavers may choose to add another descriptor to a Elemental Spawning Trap but should keep in mind that doing so makes an extremely deadly Trap.

**Elemental Swarming** – An Elemental Swarming Trap functions identically to an Elemental Spawning trap, except that each Elemental summoned is a Swarm instead. Remember that Swarms start as a minimum of 5 Tiles worth of Swarm. See more in Chapter 10: Combat Rules: Swarms for more. Weaver’s may note that Elemental Swarming Traps do not come with other descriptors such as Large, True Damage, Exhausting, or Ruining, this is because Elemental Swarming Traps are inherently very dangerous by their nature. Weavers may choose to add another descriptor to an Elemental Swarming Trap but should keep in mind that doing so makes an extremely deadly Trap.

### PHYSICAL TRAPS

Whirring blades, spring locked darts, revolving doors, and falling sand. All of these are examples of Physical Traps. Physical Traps involve dangerous hazards and obstacles that challenge a Party with direct Damage as well as adding a physical obstacle for the Party to overcome. If a Weaver wants to implement or draws a Physical Trap on the Traps Table above, they can find a more specific Trap with the Physical Trap Table, also above. Physical Traps are found with an Investigation Skill Roll or with a high Passive Perception and Disabled with a Thieves or Trap tools Equipment Skill Roll. Players or Creatures who have Triggered a Physical Trap must make a Perception Defense Roll to avoid the consequences of them. The Difficulty Level of both finding and disabling a Physical Trap can be determined separately, with the Difficulty Table above, or simply by the Weaver’s discretion.

Each Physical Trap does its own Physical Damage Type (Bludgeoning, Chopping, Piercing, or Slashing) and has its own Wound that it gives to Creatures who are unfortunate enough to fail their Perception Defense Roll against them. The Damage Value is equal to the Traps’ Lethality Tier (See Chapter 8: Equipment, Gear, & Economy: Consumables: Remedial & Lethality Tier for more information).

Each Physical Trap deals its own Wound as stated in the Physical Traps Table and in the details below. You can find more information about Wounds in Chapter 10: Combat Rules: Wounds: Wounds Chart.

Unless otherwise stated a Physical Trap will deal its appropriate Damage Type and Deal its LTH Tier Damage (LTH Tier 1 = 7 Damage, LTH Tier 2 = 9 Damage, etc)

Remember that a Creature or Player that fails their appropriate Defense Roll against a Trap also receives a Wound (Only Elemental and Physical Traps will give Wounds, Curses, Diseases, and Poisons do not), and the Traps’ LTH Tier in Levels of Exhaustion simply for failing their Defense Roll. Any additional Exhaustion or Wounds that a Trap inflicts are added to this Initial Level of Exhaustion or extra Level of Exhaustion gained by a Wound. Details of the Physical Trap sin the Physical Traps Table can be found here:

**Bounce -**  Bounce Physical Traps forcibly move Creatures with great force. While Bounce Traps do not inherently harm Creatures they move, any Creature forcibly moved by a Bounce Trap that encounters an obstacle in the way of its path will take 1 True Bludgeoning Damage. Should any other hazards exist at the end of a Creatures forced movement, the Creature may be forced to defend against those as well. Bounce Traps afflict a Creature with the Blown Away Wound moving them 10 Tiles in a Direction determined by the Weaver; or a Weaver can roll a 1d10, with 1 being “North” of the map, 2-8 being the remaining cardinal directions in a clockwise manner such that 2 is North-East, and 3 is East of the map, and 9 is forcing the Creature down towards the ground, and 10 is forcing the Creature upwards into the sky. Weavers should note that it is very easy to use a Bounce Trap to force a Creature or Player into another Trap or environmental hazard, if this is the case, have the Creature or Player Roll again to defend itself against the new obstacle.

**Scythe/Blades/Saw –** any myriad number of giant blades could fill this category. Designed to do Slicing or Chopping Damage and eviscerate any trespassers. These Traps take the form a Line, Cone, or Radial Area of Effect (as the Weaver chooses) and are as many Tiles large as they have LTH Tier. These Traps Deal their appropriate LTH Tier in either of Chopping or Slicing Damage (as the Weaver chooses) and afflict the Dismemberment or Bleeding Wound Respectively. Once Triggered these obstacles continually go off and it may be difficult to stop them without injury. The Creatures can also try to use appropriate Physical Skill Checks to bypass the Trap, such as jumping over it, or tumbling through it. The Weaver can use the Traps DL or Draw a Tarot from the Difficulty Table to determine this DL.

**Darts/Arrows –** Darts or arrows shoot from the wall, turning any who meet them into a pin cushion. Designed to do Piercing Damage (and give the Run Through Wound. These traps can come in Line, Cone, or Radial Area of Effects and have a Range of 1 – 20x LTH Tier of the Trap. Such that an LTH Tier 3 Radial Darts Traps would have a Range of 1-60 Tiles in every Direction, including vertically, Around its Origin Tile.  Once Triggered these obstacles continually go off and it may be difficult to stop them without injury. The Creatures can also try to use appropriate Physical Skill Checks to bypass the Trap, such as jumping over it, or tumbling through it. The Weaver can use the Traps DL or Draw a Tarot from the Difficulty Table to determine this DL.

**Poison Dart/Arrows –** These Traps function Identically to Darts/Arrows Traps except they give the Mortification Wound (See Chapter 10: Combat Rules: Wounds: Wounds Chart for more information) instead of the Run Through Wounds and, in addition to any effects of the Darts/Arrows The Creature affected must also roll a Fortitude Defense Roll against the Poison the Darts/Arrows have been tainted with. Draw Tarot for the Poison and the Poison’s DL on the Poison Trap Table and the Difficulty table respectively.

**Dead Weight –** Dead Weight Traps crush their intended Target. Typically a dead Weight Trap is 5 time the weight of its intended prey and is intended to crush the target in a single blow. Dead Weight Traps deal Bludgeoning Damage and the Crushing Wound Dead Weight Traps can come in Lines, Cones, or Radial Area of Effects and are as many Tiles large as they have LTH Tier. Dead Weight Traps can be one time uses, or continual such as on a swinging pendulum, or raising and dropping from the ceiling. Once Triggered these obstacles continually go off and it may be difficult to stop them without injury. The Creatures can also try to use appropriate Physical Skill Checks to bypass the Trap, such as jumping over it, or tumbling through the it.

**Spike Door/Wall -** Spike Doors/Walls are spring loaded or magically enhanced fake walls or doors that have spikes that protrude from their hidden end, Puncturing Creatures unfortunate to Trigger the Trap. The Spike Door/Wall Trap deals Piercing Damage and afflicts the Run Through Wound. Spiked Doors/Walls only come in Cone Area of Effects by their nature and are as Many Tiles Large as their LTH Tier. Spiked Doors/Walls can be single use or continually loaded and sprung again should the Trigger be activated repeatedly, at the Weaver’s discretion. Once Triggered these obstacles may continually go off and it may be difficult to stop them without injury. The Creatures can also try to use appropriate Physical Skill Checks to bypass the Trap, such as jumping over it, or tumbling through the it.

**Pitfall –** The classic “Tiger Trap” Pitfall Traps crumble when stepped on and lead to sharp stakes at the bottom impaling their targets and making escape nigh impossible. Pitfalls deal Piercing Damage and deal the Run Through Wound. A Weaver may choose to have the Pitfall have no stakes at the bottom, instead simply dealing Falling Damage (See Chapter 9: Adventuring Rules: falling Damage), or even being insidious enough to grease the walls of the Pitfall so that escape alone by climbing is impossible. Weavers are always at their discretion for what level of obstacles they feel their Players can handle. Pitfalls are inherently Radial and are as many Tiles Large as they have LTH, and are as many Tiles deep as their LTH Tier times 10. In addition, Creatures that fall into a Pitfall must also Roll again to save themselves from the Falling Damage of the Pitfall. Once Triggered these obstacles may continually go off and it may be difficult to stop them without injury. The Creatures can also try to use appropriate Physical Skill Checks to bypass the Trap, such as jumping over it, or tumbling through the it.

**Flipping Floor –** Flipping Floor Traps are nearly Identical to Pitfalls except that the entire floor may rotate capturing and sealing the entry/exit for the Creature who triggered the Trap. A Creature or Party will have to find a way to disable the Trap or find a way to creatively removed or slightly open the floor/ceiling in order to free themselves or their allies.

**Filling -**  A constant dripping water, or fine grained sands and powders fil the room. The exits seal, time is running out before the room is completely filled. The innate fears of the claustrophobic Filling Traps fill the shape or room they are in with an environment appropriate material with intention to drown or crush trespassers. Some examples are water, sand, finely ground metal shavings, ball bearings, or even more dangerous material such as acid, lava or Elemental Rot. Unless a hazardous material is filling the room a Filling trap does not deal damage but instead fills the room at an inverse rate or Rounds to LTH Tier, such that a LTH Tier 1 Filling Trap takes 5 Rounds to fill a room or shape, a LTH Tier 2 Filling Trap takes 4 Rounds to fill a room or shape, etc. The Filling Trap always goes last in Initiative for counting the Rounds.  If a room is half filled or is down to 1 Round before it completely fills the room the entrapped Creatures roll a Fortitude Defense Roll against the DL of the Filing Trap or receive the Entomb Wound. Once the room or shape is completely filled the entrapped Creatures must make Fortitude Defense Rolls or start to Suffocate/Drown. See more in Chapter 9: Adventuring Rules: Suffocation & Drowning.

**Illusory Trap –** Illusory Traps are as implied entirely in the mind of the Creature’s viewing them. Illusory Traps can often span entire rooms or shapes and are entirely fit to a Weaver’s specifications, as the Illusions themselves could be as grand as a bottomless pit or even simply as room with no doors. Should the Weaver deem that the Trap should do Damage, it does Psychic Damage equivalent to the Trap’s LTH Tier (See Chapter 8: Equipment, Gear, & Economy: Consumables: Remedial & Lethality Tier for more information), and the DL can be equivalent to the Traps’ LTH Tier or drawn from Tarot on the Difficulty Table. Illusory Traps afflict the Addled Wound, but in the minds of the Creatures or Player they may receive a different more appropriate Wound. Weavers should remember to make sure they state the perceived Wound and not the Addled Wound to their Players who have failed their Perception Defenses against an Illusory Trap to maintain the Illusion. Treat the illusory Wound as real for the Creature or Player to uphold the authenticity of the illusion. A Creature that believes it has died from a Wound, even if illusory must still go unconscious and Trust Fate in order to stabilize. This Addled Wound only takes place once the Illusion has ended or the Creature is removed from the illusion. Within the Illusory Trap Creatures are unaware of the waking world around them and while they are still able to defend themselves, they believe it is part of the illusion. Weavers can be as creative as they like with Illusory Traps as, there is no inherent Physical obstacle in the way of the Creatures or the Party.  Illusory Traps may be ongoing or continuous, if the Weaver so deems it appropriate.

**Oil and Fire –** Lobbed from a mechanism or another Creature waiting in surprise, hitting a Creature with a oi and fire gives the afflicted Creature the Ignite Wound in addition to dealing Fire Damage equal to the Traps’ LTH Tier (See Chapter 8: Equipment, Gear, & Economy: Consumables: Remedial & Lethality Tier for more information.) Oil and Fire has a Radial Area of Effect and as is as Many Tiles large as it has LTH Tier, from the Initial Target. The Oil and Fire can be lobbed from an Origin Tile that is the Traps’ LTH Tier x 5 away. Once thrown the Oil and Fire remains and burns for 1 hour per LTH Tier the Trap possess or until it is removed. Creatures walking through or starting their Turn in the Oil and Fire receive the Ignite Wound in addition to dealing Fire Damage equal to the Traps’ LTH Tier. A Creature cannot be attempted to be Damaged by this effect more than once per Round.

**Bear Trap -**  A flash of steel, the crunch of bone, and the scream of pain is all most Creatures feel when they first trigger a Bear Trap. Bear Traps deal Piercing Damage but give the Dismemberment/Disabling Wound instead of Run Through. A Creature that triggers a Bear Trap has one or more of its legs, or ambulatory limbs disabled or nearly dismembered entirely. The Trap is designed to immobilize the Creature and gives the caught Creature the Restrained Condition. Unlike typical Restrain Conditions, this Restrain Condition can only be removed if the Bear Trap is Disabled, broken, or the Creature is somehow physically removed from the Trap. The Creature or its allies can attempt to use a Brawn Skill Roll with a DL equal to the Traps’ LTH Tier (See Chapter 8: Equipment, Gear, & Economy: Consumables: Remedial & Lethality Tier for more information.) or determined on the Difficulty Table to open the trap and escape.

**Closing Walls –** The walls rumble and shift unrelentingly towards the trespassers, intending to crush them into stains. Closing Wall Traps have one or more of the walls of a room or shape close in, creating a tight space that crushes trespassers. Crushing Walls Function Identically to Filling Traps except that instead of the Entomb Wound a Closing Wall trap deals Bludgeoning Damage and the Crushing Wound when only 1 Round is left before the wall closes. Closing Wall Traps activate as many walls, ceilings, or floors as the Weaver likes for the description of the Trap.

**Sound Trap /Alarm –** A trip wire sprung, a plate stepped on and a loud shrieking noise continuously rings alerting any and all to your presence. A Sound/Alarm Trap does not deal Damage, nor does it give a Wound but Creatures a loud ringing that gives the Deafened Condition to all the Creatures that are within its area. Creatures that are withing the Traps’ LTH Tier x 20 Tiles have the Deafened Condition, and the Alarm itself can be heard twice as far as that (LTH Tier x 40 Tiles). The Alarm can only be silenced by disabling the Trap or by having the key or bypass system available and using the Interact with an Object Action.  Sound/Alarm Traps can often include other effects such as lights, or even themselves be the Trigger for another Trap. The Sound/Alarm Trap acts as if an “Alarms Raised” Circumstance Tarot has been drawn. See Chapter 9: Adventuring Rules: Circumstance Tarot: Infiltrations, Dungeons, & Lairs for more information.

**Grease / Tar Trap -** Either placed ahead of time or suddenly poured our a Grease Trap can impede the ability of Creatures to move freely. A Grease Trap is Radial in Area of Effect and is as large as its LTH Tier x 5 in Tiles. This Trap does not deal Damage but does afflict the affected Creatures with the Blown Away Wound. Grease Traps force a Creature to slip and slide away without any traction. A Creature in a grease trap must roll an Acrobatics Skill Roll against a DL equal to the Trap’s DL or drawn from Tarot on the Difficulty Table or be moved in its intended direction as it was affected by the Blown Away Wound (10 Tiles). Creatures who succeed on their Acrobatics Skill Roll may move half of their normal Movement Speed (Rounded Down) and any movement in the Grease leaves a Creature Open. Creatures that are Prone in the Grease must make an additional Acrobatics Skill Roll simply to stand up from Prone, also leaving the Creature Open. Tar Traps function Identically to Grease Traps except instead of the Blown Away Wound they instead Restrain a Creature. Creatures that are Prone in Tar Traps are Pinned instead of Restrained. Creatures must use a Brawn Skill Check to free themselves from the Tar Trap instead of an Acrobatics Skill Check.  A Tar Trap uses the Entomb Wound instead of the Blown Away Wound.

**Grenade -**  Waiting to by set off by trip wire, or simply timed, Grenade Traps detonate one Stack of Combat Grenades. Grenade Traps function identically to a Creature using the Combat Grenade with an Attack, Damage, and Wound identical to the Grenade thrown. See Chapter 8: Equipment, Gear, & Economy: Grenades for more information. 

**Combat Trap –** Combat Traps detonate one Stack of Combat Traps. Combat Traps function identically to a Creature using the Combat Trap with an Attack, Damage, and Wound identical to the Combat Trap used. See Chapter 8: Equipment, Gear, & Economy: Combat Traps for more information. 

**Entangling Net –** A Weighted Net Trap entangles and immobilizes Creatures. The Net is a Radial Area of Effect and is as large as its LTH Tier x5 in Tiles. The Net deals no Damage and has no Wound but instead gives the Creatures caught in it the Pinned Condition. Removing the Net is far harder than breaking or cutting the Net and Weavers should ensure that whatever DL is assigned to the Entangling Net whether by Weaver choice, or by drawn Tarot from the Difficulty Table, that the DL to physically lift and remove the Net Trap for a caught Creature is at least 2 higher than the DL to disable the Trap. The Net can also be broken and has a Hit Threshold value of 2 for Rope or 5 for metal nets, +1 for each inch of thickness the Rope or mettle thread has. An Entangling Net has 1 inch of thickness per LTH Tier it is.

**Thorn Net -**  A Thorn Net Trap is identical to an Entangling Net Trap except that for any Attempted Action that is a Major, Minor, or Movement Action, the Creature must roll a successful Combat Defense Roll against the LTH Tier Attack Value of the Thorn Net or take the Thorn Net’s LTH Tier Damage Value in Piercing Damage. Grenade Traps detonate one Stack of Combat Grenades. Grenade Traps function identically to a Creature using the Combat Grenade with an Attack, Damage, and Wound identical to the Grenade thrown. See Chapter 8: Equipment, Gear, & Economy: Grenades for more information.  This Damage does not deal a Wound. Weavers who wis to offer a greater challenge may also poison the barbs of the Thorn Net Trap in a manner similar to the Poisoned Darts/Arrows Trap described above.

**Gravity Changing –** magic forces the natural gravity of the room or shape to change. The Weaver can choose the direction the natural gravity of the room or shape now changes to, whether it be a wall or the ceiling. This Trap does no Damage but does do Falling Damage if a Creature “falls” far enough, see Chapter 9: Adventuring Rules: Falling Damage for more information. Any Creature affected by this Trap suffers the Untether Wound. Gravity Changing Traps usually have an Area of Effect that is the Entire room or shape they are in, although a more experienced Weaver may choose to limit the radius of the Trap to another Area of Effect of their choice in order to show leniency or to create a more dangerous situation for their Players. Clever Weavers will recognize that this means many doors or other important elements of the Dungeon may be inaccessible to those stuck on the walls or ceiling of the room or shape they are in. 

**Teleporting Trap -**  A simple blip* and a Creature(s) is missing. Creatures that Trigger Teleporting Traps are instantly Teleported to another random location in the Dungeon. The Weaver is encouraged to find the best way to find Randomly select rooms and spots in rooms or shapes of their dungeon. It is recommended to sue the Tarot Deck or to Roll d10’s to get this effect. Weavers could use a first draw or roll to determine the room or shape and a second to determine the specific Tile they land in. Creatures affected by this Trap take no Damage from the Trap itself but do suffer the Untethered Wound. This Trap can be particularly deadly as it is highly possible for a Creature or Player to land in a room or shape surrounded by enemies or Trigger another trap, while they suffer from the Unterthered Wound. It is advised to keep how potentially dangerous a Teleporting Trap can be in mind when creating a Dungeon. In order to lessen the effects or create dramatic tension a Weaver may also choose that there is a definitive Tile that a Creature will be Teleported to. Creative Players may be able to use that knowledge to their advantage and should be rewarded for their creativity and puzzle solving.

**Obliteration Orb -**  Powerful obliterative magical orbs float inches from the ground, annihilating everything in its path. Almost nothing in Amarant can withstand the destructive force of an Obliteration Orb. The Spheres are 1 Tile in Radius Per LTH Tier they have and can either travel at a rate of 5 Tiles per Round as the last Creature to move in Initiative, following the Creature whom Triggered them or at random. To determine Random Direction rolls a 1d10, with 1 Being North in the room or shape, and going clockwise following the cardinal directions (2 would be North-East, 3 would be East etc..) rerolling 9 or 10’s. Obliteration Orbs float and can move up or down hills or stairs without touching the ground, otherwise, Obliteration Orbs are not subject to gravity and may float anywhere.  Creatures that the Orb touches take their 10 True Arcane Damage for each LTH Tier/Size the Orb has. The Orb passes through Creatures or walls unfailingly if it has the movement to do so. Creatures that survive being touched by the Orb by some miracle, suffer the Voided Wound. The Defense of is always Dodge Defense. Obliteration Orbs can be prevented from being activated with a Perception Defense Roll like other Traps but a Creature can only avoid touching one with a Dodge Defense Roll against the LTH Tier of the Obliteration Orb. Obliteration Orbs are by far the deadliest Trap in Amarant and releasing them may very well have consequences for the shape and structure of the Dungeon or even the surrounding environment at large. A Counter Cast or other sufficient Ability that can remove or shut down magical effects can be used to destroy an Obliteration Orb at a DL of 5 + 1 Per LTH Tier the Orb possesses. Creatures that are reduced to 0 Hit Points by the Orbs are reduced to atoms, unable to be resurrected. If a Creature loses Hit Points to an Obliteration Orb, they are unable to regain those Hit Points and those limbs or body parts are reduced to atoms and lost forever.  Unless Restored by an Ability or Potion (Anilities and Potions that grant Hit Points do not restore lost limbs, only potions and Abilities such as a Potion of Restoration can do so). The only Material known to resist an Obliteration Orb is Gray Adamant, a nigh indestructible metal, but even this metal succumbs to the Obliteration Orb at a rate of 1 Hit Threshold per Round/10 Seconds it is in contact. Weavers should be aware that the very structure of their Dungeon is at risk when using such a Trap and that for most Creatures or Players to touch one is nearly instant death without chance of resurrection as it utterly destroys the body.

### DIFFICULTY

The Difficulty Table is used for a Weaver to determine the DL or Difficulty Level of a particular Trap or other Dungeon Obstacle. Normally Weavers may refer to the [[2 CORE RULES#DIFFICULTY TIER TABLE|RMD/LTH Table]] to determine an appropriate DL for a Trap or obstacle. However, in order to create more variance for obstacles such as determining the DL to find a Trap and a second DL to disable that Trap. If Weavers consistently use the same DL for both, they will find their Players will quickly be able to catch on to this and would make these obstacles significantly less interesting and challenging. To counter this, it is recommended to draw a Tarot card for each Dungeon Element one has, after all of the other Dungeon Elements (Shape/Room, Doors, Traps, Encounters,) have been drawn. This way a Weaver can give their Players a more randomized experience that is still within their Players Level Range. The Difficulty table has two options for each card, one that uses the LTH Tier and one that uses the Player’s Level as a variable. Clever Weavers will realize that these values are identical, and they are both listed simply for convenience’s sake. 

Weavers can Also use the diffuclyt table above to help them create Encounters. For example, if on the Encounter Table you draw a 13, which is a Deadly Swarm Encounter. One can use the Difficulty table to determine the individual Levels of the adversaries in the Encounter compared to the Party’s Level.
