## YOUR OWN ADVENTURE

 What has been talked about above is in the base or “template” setting of Kismet. However, Kismet is adaptable. A [[#CORE RULES#BASIC RULES|WEAVER]] (see Basic Rules below) can choose to create a world of their own design, using the same mechanics but a different setting. Different settings allow for a different feel of the game, a wuxia or futuristic setting has a completely different feel from the fantasy base that Kismet uses. Use a setting that makes sense for your campaigns and the worlds you wish to create.

## BASIC RULES

In Kismet, one player takes the role of the Weaver or game master. The other players take the role of player Characters. A group of player Characters is known as a party. In the game, the Weaver describes a scene, to which the player’s role-play their Character’s traits and abilities to react to the scene. When the outcome of an action is not clear, dice need to be rolled to determine if the action was successful or not. For example, there is no need to roll for climbing a ladder or using the stairs, but a roll would have to be made for scaling a cliff face.

A scene is described as a setting in which one event takes place. A scene could be set by a location, a time, or an event, and can become a new scene with a dynamic change to that location, time, or event. For example, all the party member's meeting at a tavern is one scene in which they can roleplay. One player then might start a bar brawl, which is a new event, this new event creates a new scene.

##  PLAYING, ROLE-PLAYING, & STATISTICS

Kismet is played with at least 2 people one Weaver, and a Player, typically, However, Kismet is played with 4 or More Players and 1 Weaver. Kismet gameplay consists of Player as Characters and someone who takes on the role of the Weaver. The Weaver is the person in charge of world building, creating non-Player Characters, monsters in that world, and most importantly telling the story and consequences of the Player's actions. The other Players take on the role of Characters. Characters, much like in a book or movie, are played by the Players as the main Characters of a story with the Weaver telling the consequences of the Character's actions. Players role play their Character's attributes and personalities to create a story alongside a Weaver’s discretion. For example, Jeff (playing the Character Azag the Dire Orc) and his friend the Weaver are playing. The Weaver describes the scene in front of Azag, then Jeff says what he thinks Azag would do in the scene, the Weaver then tells Jeff the consequence of that action.

  **Side Note: In these rules, The Characters of Azag and Giles will be referenced for examples of play. Azag is a Level 5 XYZ and a heroic Dire Orc adventurer, and Giles the Meek, also a Level 5 XYZ, is a reluctant but faithful Puck Squire to Azag. 

Weaver: _A cool breeze sweeps over you on this particularly hot day. The sun is blazing and the soft smell of the forest is nearby. You come to a fork in the road, with a sign pointing each direction. The sign pointing left reads “The kingdom of Gallia” while the sign on the right reads: The Wandering Goat Inn”_

Jeff (playing Agaz the Dire Orc): _Agaz isn’t too familiar with the area so he will choose randomly_ *puts on his orc voice* _Agaz likes left, left is good direction._

Weaver: _As you travel to the Kingdom of Gallia, you hear a rustling in the bushes, it's an ambush! Highwaymen are attacking you_

Jeff: *talking normally* I draw my axe and prepare to fight, *in Agaz voice* _Agaz will destroy you all!_

Notice in this example, that the Weaver created a scene, to which Jeff’s

Character, Agaz, reacted to. Jeff is roleplaying his Character Agaz, and making the decision that Agaz would make, not necessarily the ones he himself will make.

## DICE ROLLS

While playing there may be times (especially in combat) where the outcome of an action is not entirely clear. For example, a Character choosing to walk across a small stream needs merely to describe the Character's doing it, but a Character who is trying to swim through a rushing river may or may not fail. When situations such as those occur, the Player may need to make a dice roll to determine the success of the action. A Weaver decides whether an action needs a roll (unless there are rules for rolling dice for such actions).

There are three main types of dice rolls: Attack Rolls, Defense Rolls, and Skill Rolls. These rolls and all rolls in Kismet are determined with ten-sided dice. These rolls are used mostly in combat however can also be used outside of combat. In the example above, where a player tries to swim through a river, an Athletics Skill Roll must be made to determine if the Character is successful. The player adds the appropriate MODIFIERS to the roll (An Athletics Skill Roll for instance would include a dice roll plus the total number of Athletics value they has (See below Chapter 2: Statistics & General Rules) for a more detailed example and breakdown of the Values and Modifiers). A player rolls their dice trying to beat a [[2 CORE RULES#DIFFICULTY TIER TABLE|DIFFICULTY LEVEL]] or “[[2 CORE RULES#DIFFICULTY TIER TABLE|DL]]” which represents how challenging the action the Character is trying to accomplish is, as well as fate (represented by the die roll). A Player need only meet the value of the [[2 CORE RULES#DIFFICULTY TIER TABLE|DIFFICULTY LEVEL]] to succeed, this means on a tie the Player succeeds. The short and easy version of this is “Meet or Beat” a [[2 CORE RULES#DIFFICULTY TIER TABLE|DL]]. This rule is referred to as the “**Meet to Beat**” rule.

   The short form notation for dice follows “number of dice-“d”-number of sides on a die” so a “1d10” is one singular, ten-sided die. Whereas “2d10” would be two separate, ten-sided dice.

For a practical example, Agaz attempts to swim across the river, Jeff rolls a ten-sided die and adds his athletics modifier (for this example we will say it is +2). He gets a roll of a 7 from the die, and then adds his +2 for a total (also known as a “VALUE”) of 9. The Weaver uses his own discretion as well as the guidelines found in Adventuring rules (See Adventuring Rules) section, to determine that a fair Difficulty Level is DL 7. Since Agaz’s 9 is larger than 7, Agaz successfully swims across the river. If Agaz’s roll had been a 3 or lower (4+2 would only have been a 5 and not high enough to Meet to Beat the DL of 7) he would have failed to swim across the river. Below is a list of sample DL to give an idea for what DL is appropriate for a challenge. Below that is a Chart known as the DIFFICULTY TIER TABLE. This chart exists as tool for Weaver’s and Players to have quick access to DL’s of appropriate values for any point of play. 

## CRITICAL SUCCESSES & FAILURES

 The Roll of a 10 on an Attack, Defense, or Skill Roll is a CRITICAL SUCCESS. The implications of a Critical Success differs slightly between the types of Rolls (Attack, Defense, or Skill Rolls) and more information for Attack and Defenses can be found in Chapter 10: Combat Rules, and more information for Skills can be found below in this chapter. For Attack, Defense, and Skill Rolls a Critical Success grants you an additional +5 to the total value of the Roll.

 The Roll of a 1 on an Attack, Defense, or Skill Roll is a CRITICAL FAILURE. The implications of a Critical Failure differs slightly between the types of Rolls (Attack, Defense, or Skill Rolls) and more information for Attack and Defenses can be found in Chapter 10: Combat Rules, and more information for Skills can be found below in this chapter.

## REROLLING DICE

Often in Kismet Abilities and other effects may ask a Weaver or Player to reroll any of their already rolled dice. When doing so you must accept the result of the reroll regardless of if it is lower than the original roll.

## BONUS & PENALTY DICE

Occasionally a Character is in a position of advantage or disadvantage when they perform an action. For example, a Character that has been blinded would be at a disadvantage to hit someone with their sword, said Character who is blind, is also at a disadvantage to hit someone with their sword; said Character who is blind, is also at a disadvantage to defending themselves from other Creatures’ attacks.  themselves from other Creature’s attacks. In these situations, Characters gain a **BONUS DIE** or **PENALTY DIE**. A Character gain a Bonus Die when that Character has an advantage on the roll they perform, and a Penalty Die when they are disadvantaged to perform an action. When a Character receives a Bonus Die, they roll an extra 1d10 in addition to their Primary 1d10 and add its results to the roll’s value. For example, Agaz attacks a restrained goblin, he has an advantage due to the restraint of his foe so he gains a Bonus Die. He rolls 1d10+1 (in this example his attack modifier is +1) as his regular attack, as his Primary Die, and then adds a bonus 1d10, totaling 2d10+1. In a similar manner, a Penalty Die makes the Character roll an additional die, but instead subtracts its result from the Primary Die. The goblin calls for his friends who then surround Agaz, because Agaz is surrounded he is at a disadvantage to defend himself, so Agaz has a Penalty Die to his defense roll. The Agaz rolls 1d10+1 as his Primary Die, for his defense and then rolls a second 1d10, subtracting the second roll from the value (including modifier) of the first roll. The Weaver determines if a Character has a Bonus or Penalty Die unless it is stated in the rules that a Character does so with a specific action or effect. If a Character is in a situation in which they would receive a Bonus Die from one source and a Penalty Die from another, the two dice cancel each other out, and therefore the Character rolls as normal. Bonus Dies and Penalty Dies do not stack, such that you cannot get multiple Bonus Dies or multiple Penalty Dies. Creatures that are not Player Characters cannot receive Bonus Dies and Penalty Dies, instead the Player Character receives a Bonus Die when the opposing non-player Creature should have a Penalty Die, and the Player Character receives a Penalty Die when the opposing non-player Creature is in a position of advantage, as described above with Azag.

If you are ever called to reroll a roll on a Bonus Die or a Penalty Die, simply reroll both dice, but still remember to assign one of those dice as the Primary Die.

## THE GRID

 Kismet is played on a tile mat consisting of 1-inch by 1-inch squares. Each of these squares called Tiles in Kismet are representative of 5 cubic feet of space or volume. The Tiles serve as visual space for the Weaver and the Players to interact with the world around them. The Tiles include everything in the Scene, from the environment and any Creatures or Players. Each Creature, player, or object takes up a set amount of space or Tiles based on its Size (See Chapter 9: Adventuring Rules: Size & Reach). The Tiles are also used to measure distance, in increments of up to 5ft, such that a distance of 2-3 Tiles is a range of 10-15ft (remember a Tile is a space of 5 cubic feet), encompassing all the numbers in that range. 

##  DISTANCE & MOVEMENT

While Kismet uses a grid system to calculate and measure spaces, the worlds Made in Kismet mimic real life. There are more than simple edges and discrete cut-offs, there are curves and continuations in a realistic world and this is true in Kismet as well. Moving from one Tile to another regardless of diagonal or cardinal movement will always count as moving 1 Tile. When measuring Area of Effects, that is Attacks, Actions, or Abilities that target more than 1 Tile in a cluster, apply this rule as well. In this manner, diagonal space does not cost more or less than cardinal grid space. (See templates) 

## RANGE 0

Kismet also has a unique range of distance called Range 0. 0 is the same as being within the same Tile as an object or Creature. While this could mean that Creatures within 0 Range of each other are directly on top of one another, they could also be standing side by side within 5 ft the same of each other. For Creatures that are of a larger Size (See more in Chapter 9: Adventuring Rules: Size & Reach) Their 0 Range is any tile their miniature would physically occupy. There are some exceptions to when a Player or Creature can share space at 0 Range. (See more in Chapter 9: Adventuring Rules: Size & Reach: Sharing Space)

## HOW TO ACTIVELY ROLE-PLAY

Active role play will vary from group to group, however, there are two general ways of doing this. The first is to talk as if you were the Character. This does not necessarily mean talking in an accent (although it can), but it means talking to other party members or NPCs as if they were their Character. For example, Jeff is playing Agaz, Jeff might say “I attack the bar keep”

This is not talking in Character but merely stating the action he intends Agaz to do. If instead Jeff put on his deepest voice and said “This is the best ale I ever drank. Bartender, give me another!” and tells the Weaver that he smashes his tankard on the ground. Then Jeff has actively roleplayed Agaz by using Agaz’s words, not his own words. Sometimes the line between whether a Character is saying something in-game or a player is saying something outside of the game can be a blur. If you find this is an issue, consider using a role-playing prop (such as a hat or other badge that might represent the Character). If the player is wearing the prop, they are talking in Character, if they are not wearing it then they are speaking as a player.

The second way to actively roleplay is to have players act out their actions along with their dialogue. This is more activity on the player’s part and can make sessions last longer since it takes time for the acting out of the Character's actions, however, many groups find the experience significantly more enjoyable and memorable.

There are some groups that are not as comfortable with too much active role playing for various reasons such as being new to a group, having never role played before, or just being generally uncomfortable with active roleplaying. While normally a Weaver should only allow active roleplaying to be rewarded with the ROLE PLAY POINTS (RPP) (Described Below), a Weaver should ask the group if they are comfortable role playing actively. If they are not, you can still give rewards through Role Play Points to player’s that make their Character perform actions that exemplify their personality traits and flaws; so that those players can still participate in role-play, but consider throwing them incentives (such as more points for breaking out of their shell.)

## ROLE PLAY POINTS (RPP)

**Roleplay points (RPP for short)** are points accumulated by Players for roleplaying their characters in a scene. A Player can only earn Role Play Points once per Scene collect 1 RPP per scene (or 2 points in one scene if roleplaying a flaw or creating a setback for the party, see below) and can only hold a maximum of 10 RPP. Player’s can spend three points on a **FORTUNE** (explained below) to help their character in various ways. Fortunes represents the Player manipulating the fate of the character.  As mentioned earlier, a Player can earn a 1 RPP when they actively roleplay their character by using one or more of their Character's **CHARACTER ATTRIBUTES, TRAITS, REASON FOR ADVENTURING, PARTY BONDS or RELIGION** however if a Player roleplays one of their Character's **FLAWS, or PHOBIAS**, they earn 2 RPP instead of 1. Players are responsible for keeping track of their own RPP; however Players need to confirm with their Weaver that their role play was in accordance with their xharacter's Attributes and thus can be awarded the RPP. 

## FORTUNES

 When using a Fortune and the outcome of the fortune was unfavorable, the Player can spend more points in the same turn to repeat fortunes, as long as they have the points to do so. Fortunes can be used in the following ways:  
  
  
A Player may spend 3 RPP to re-roll any roll made by the Player's Character, after it has been made but This Re-Roll must be done before the next Creature takes its turn.      

A Player may spend 3 RPP to at any time during a Round of combat choose a Tarot card of your choice when determining the Initiative order, (See Chapter 10: Combat Rules: Initiative). If a Creature had already pulled that card for initiative, that Creature pulls a new card, and you take its place. These changes can also be used affect the Circumstance Tarot in play in any scene (See Chapter 9: Adventuring Rules: Circumstance Tarot). Note that you may not change the results of a Trust Fate Tarot Draw (See Chapter 3: Tarot: Trust Fate)

- A Player may spend 3 RPP to change one of the Daily Tarot, but you may not change the results of a Trust Fate Tarot Draw.

- A Player may spend 3 RPP to prevent a Character from dying and go Unconscious instead.

- A Player can choose to spend 3 RPP on another Player’s Character to perform any of the fortunes listed above to that Player’s Character.

## TECHNICAL TERMS

Before continuing to read through this book, here is a quick list of terms you may see and their meanings.

**BONUS/PENALTY

 is a termed used to denote an additional NUMERIC that gets summed with the Modifier of a dice roll.

**BOON/BANE

 is a termed used to denote a particular EFFECT that can be a good thing for the Character (Boon) or a bad thing for that Character (Bane).  Boons and Banes are effects that do not involve a numeric value. 

**CREATURE

 is a termed used to denote a particular individual that exists in the world the Weaver has created. A Creature can refer to an ally, an enemy, or a Player or Non-Player Character.

**PLAYER

 is a termed used to denote a particular Person who is playing Kismet’s Character in game. The Term “Creature” otherwise almost always applies to this term as well.

**PROFICIENCY

 is a termed used to denote that a Character has that skill or training. A Character who is Proficient in a SKILL, DEFENSE, or ATTACK can use their full [[2 CORE RULES#LEVEL|Level]], to determine their modifier (SEE BELOW in the STATISTIC SECTION). A Character who is not Proficient in any statistic only adds their [[2 CORE RULES#LEVEL|Level]], divided by 2 rounded down (minimum 0) to that Skill, Defense, or Attack MODIFIER.

**MODIFIER

 is a termed used to denote a Character’s expertise in a particular statistic. Modifiers are always whole numbers and are added to die rolls to determine VALUES.

**VALUES

 is a termed used to denote a total sum of a die roll and accompanying modifiers. A Value is used to determine a Character’s success against a difficulty level (DL). A value must “Meet to Beat” a difficulty level in order for a Character to succeed.

## STATISTICS & GENERAL RULES

Alongside the roleplaying aspect, Kismet has a numerical aspect to represent how good a Character is at performing Abilities, Skills, and Actions. The higher the number, the better your Character is at that Action or Skill. These numbers are referred to as the Character’s Statistics, a Character has the following statistics: ABILITIES, [[2 CORE RULES#LEVEL|Level]],, TIER OF POWER, HIT POINTS, SPEED, ATTACK, DAMAGE, DEFENSE, ARMOR VALUE, and SKILL values.

### ABILITIES

[[7 Abilities|Abilities]] are the special traits and powers that separate players from common peoples. They are the individual talents and learned skills that make a Character unique. Abilities are separated into two categories **COMMON ABILITIES**, which are the lowest level of power (Tier of Power 0). They represent everyday skills and knowledge that anyone can learn. And **HEROIC ABILITIES** that represent powerful displays of martial prowess, or spells, or actions that a heroic Character (like Player Characters) can perform. Heroic abilities are labelled in measures of power called [[2 CORE RULES#TIERS OF POWER|TIERS OF POWER]] from Tier 1 being the weakest, and Tier 5 being the most powerful (often abbreviated as T1, T2, T3, T4, and T5). Each player Character at [[2 CORE RULES#LEVEL|Level]], 1 starts with a certain number of Common and Heroic Abilities as shown on the chart below in the [[2 CORE RULES#LEVEL|LEVEL]] section. At every odd level past the first  [[2 CORE RULES#LEVEL|LEVEL]], a player Character earns a new  [[2 CORE RULES#TIERS OF POWER|Tiers of Power]] of [[7 ABILITIES|Abilities]] to choose from, as well as gains a new Common Ability to learn. When you learn a new Heroic Ability, you can choose to learn any ability of your current Tier of Power or lower, you may even choose to take a Common Ability instead of a Heroic Ability. When you gain a Common Ability, by reaching an odd [[2 CORE RULES#LEVEL|Level]],, that Common Ability cannot be replaced with a Heroic Ability. For more information on abilities see the [[7 ABILIITIES|Abilities]] section

### LEVEL

A [[2 CORE RULES#LEVEL|Level]], is a numerical representation of how powerful your Character is relative to other Creatures and monsters. Each Character starts at [[2 CORE RULES#LEVEL|Level]] 1 and can attain a maximum of level 10. Each time you [[2 CORE RULES#LEVEL|Level]] increases your [[2 CORE RULES#ATTACK|Attack]], [[2 CORE RULES#DEFENSE|Defense]], and [[2 CORE RULES#SKILLS|Skill]] statistics increase. As mentioned earlier you also gain new abilities as you [[2 CORE RULES#LEVEL|Level]] increases. To increase your [[2 CORE RULES#LEVEL|Level]] your Character must gain enough experience through completing quests or fighting enemies, or by advancing far enough into the story. (See [[11 EXPERIENCE, ENCOUNTERS, & DUNGEON BUILDING| EXPERIENCE ENCOUNTERS, & DUNGEON BUILDING]]), See the chart below to see how many abilities you get at each [[2 CORE RULES#LEVEL|Level]].

### Level and Abilities Known Chart

 At first [[2 CORE RULES#LEVEL|Level]] you get 2 of the 4 Common Abilities’ from your race, and 1 from your background nd 1 from your faction rank.*

At first [[2 CORE RULES#LEVEL|Level]] you will gain a “Unique racial ability” and a “Unique faction ability” which are equivalent to Tier 1 Heroic Abilities, but do not count against your number of abilities known.**

While Player Characters are [[2 CORE RULES#LEVEL|Level]] 1, most regular people and mundane Creatures are [[2 CORE RULES#LEVEL|Level]]  0-1, meaning that they are unable to perform most Heroic Abilities (although there are always exceptions). All Creatures and people in Kismet possess trace amounts of power from all the power sources, they do not have enough aptitude to necessarily perform Heroic Abilities.

### TIERS OF POWER

Tiers of power is a secondary representation of how powerful a Character or Creature is. While it is directly tied to that Creature or Character’s [[2 CORE RULES#LEVEL|Level]], it determines what strength or magnitude the abilities of that Creature or Character are. Your Tier of Power is equal to your [[2 CORE RULES#LEVEL|Level]],l divided by 2 rounded (down, minimum 1).  Such that:

| Level(s) | Tier of Power |
|:--------:|:-------------:|
|   1-2    |       1       |
|   3-4    |       2       |
|   5-6    |       3       |
|   7-8    |       4       |
|   9-10   |       5       |

[[2 CORE RULES#TIERS OF POWER|Tiers of Power]]  range from 1-5, 1st tier or Tier 1 abilities are the lowest in power, and 5th Tier or Tier 5 Heroic Abilities which consist of legendary abilities at the peak of mortal capability.

## PROFICIENCY

Proficiency is your level of competency with a weapon, defense, skill or other item. If you are Proficient you add your [[2 CORE RULES#LEVEL|Level]], plus any Bonuses from Abilities or items to your roll, if you are not Proficient you only add half your [[2 CORE RULES#LEVEL|Level]],(rounded down, minimum 0) plus Bonuses from Abilities or items. You are automatically Proficient with all weapons, foci and armor you find as a [[2 CORE RULES#LEVEL|Level]], 1 Character, but not with all Skills or Defenses.

### HIT POINTS (HP), STABILZATION, & DEATH

These numbers represent how wounded your Character currently is. Most Creatures and all races have a base of 10 hit points or HP. When this number reaches 0, your Character gains the Unconscious Condition (see Chapter 10: Combat Rules” Conditions & Conditions List). When your Character is Unconscious, you must TRUST FATE to see if your Character Stabilizes or succumbs to their injuries (See Chapter 3: Tarot: Trust Fate).  A Creature that is Stabilized is no longer at risk of dying from its injuries but is still at 0 Hit Points and are Unconscious for an hour at 0 Hit Points. An Unconscious Creature wakes up in 1 hour with 1 Hit Point if it has Stabilized. A Creatures with at least 1 Hit Point is awake and alert, but is Prone. Enemy Creatures are killed rather than fall Unconscious when they reach zero Hit Points unless the Weaver decides that is appropriate for it to fall Unconscious instead. If you would take damage that would reduce you past 0 Hit Points you instead set your HP to zero as there is no negative HP. If a Creature or Character’s HP is set to zero by an attack that is a CRITICAL SUCCESS (See below Chapter 2: Playing and Role-Playing: Attack) they are instantly dead, and unable to Trust Fate to stabilize, or If an Unconscious Creature, even if they are Stabilized, takes any more damage after being Unconscious, they die; unless they have Role Play Points to prevent the Character from dying in which case the Character gains or remains in the Unconscious Condition instead.

#### TEMPORARY HIT POINTS      

Some Abilities grant TEMPORARY HIT POINTS. Temporary Hit Points function identically to Hit Points except:

·       Temporary Hit Points are always reduced before regular Hit Points, acting like a buffer before your Hit Points are reduced. 

·       May exceed a Creature or player’s maximum Hit Points, but do not alter the Maximum Hit Points Value

·       Expire after some time, defined by the Ability that granted them

·       Cannot be restored through Healing

·       Re-using an Ability to gain Temporary Hit Points only refreshes the Ability and destroys previous Temporary Hit Points gained from the Ability

·       Temporary Hit Points unless specifically stated otherwise are not additive with other sources of Temporary Hit Points.  

###           SPEED

Speed represents how quickly your Character moves; the number shows how many Tiles a Creature can move in a turn. Speed also determines how quickly a Character or Creature can set pace, and perform athletic abilities such as jumping, climbing or, swimming, as part of your movement Action instead of as a Major Action (as physical Skill Rolls usually require a Major Action). As a general rule, a Creature that succeeds an Athletic Skill Roll for climbing or swimming can move half of its full Speed Value rounded down for that type of movement. Some Creatures may have different types of Speed such as a Climb Speed, Swim Speed, Burrow Speed, or Fly Speed. A Creature with a unique Speed type can move its full unique Speed Type under those conditions without having to make a Skill Roll. For example, a Creature with 10 Speed and 8 Climb Speed can move a full 8 Tiles while climbing without an Athletics Skill Roll but would have to make an Athletics Skill Roll to move its at half of its full Speed Value rounded down (5 Tiles) while Swimming, as it does not have a Swim Speed. (See More in Chapter 9: Adventuring Rules: Non-Standard Movement).  Unless otherwise stated, any Abilities that effect Speed also effect these unique Speed types if a Creature has them. Additionally, standing up from a Prone position uses up half of your full Speed (rounded up) for that Turn.

#### MOVING THROUGH ALLIES

Creatures and Players may always move through allies but they cannot move through non-allied Creatures unless an Ability gives them the power to do so.

A Creature that is mounted or a mount themselves may pass through an ally as part of its movement Speed, however a vehicle may not without potentially injuring their allies. For more information see Chapter 8: Equipment, Gear, & Economy for more information

### ATTACK

Attack bonus represents your Character's ability to successfully land Attacks and Abilities on opponents. All Characters are Proficient with all weapons, armors and foci ( or focus for singular, foci refers to a weapon type used to amplify magic in Kismet, examples are wands and wizard’s staves). Your Character’s Attack Modifier is equal to your Character's [[2 CORE RULES#LEVEL|Level]], For more details about Attack and Attack Rolls see Chapter 10: Combat Rules

### DAMAGE

Damage is how many Hit Points a Creature or Player does when successfully attacking another Creature. See more in Chapter 10: Combat Rules.

### DEFENSE

Defense bonus represents a Player Character’s ability to react and defend against incoming attacks. Defense Modifier equals the Character’s [[2 CORE RULES#LEVEL|Level]],, plus any Modifiers from items or abilities totaling to a defense value, such as shields or armors. More details for the individual Defenses see Chapter 10: Combat Rules.

#### PASSIVE DEFENSES

When a Player is not making an active Defense Roll, but still needs to defend themselves, such as in instances like: Perceiving Traps they have not actively searched for or using the Leadership Skill to remove the fear from a frightened Creature (see below in SKILLS) you may use Passive Defenses. A Passive Defense is equal to that Character or Creatures’ Defense Modifier +5. For more detail son Passive Defenses see Chapter 10: Combat Rules.  

###           ARMOR VALUE       

Armor value represents your Characters or other Creatures; ability to shrug off incoming Damage through their own skill and the protection provided from armor or abilities. See more in Chapter 10: Combat Rules.

###           SKILLS

Skills are the training, knowledge, and proficiencies your Character has that helps them explore the world around them. A Character gains Proficiency in Skills from its Common Abilities stemming from their Race, Background, Faction, Rank, and Thematically (See Chapter 4: Races, Chapter 5: Personality, & Chapter 6 Backgrounds & Factions). A Character’s Skill Modifier is as a base always equal to their [[2 CORE RULES#LEVEL|Level]], for any Skills they are Proficient in and only half of their [[2 CORE RULES#LEVEL|Level]],rounded down (minimum 0) for Skills they are not Proficient with. Unlike Attack and Defense rolls, the roll of a 1 or a 10 does not necessarily grant an automatic success or automatic failure for Skill Rolls; instead, take the total value (roll + modifier) to determine the result. As a reminder, the Skill Roll is successful if it is greater than or equals the Difficulty Level (DL) of the task. 

There are three types of Skills, Physical Skills, Mental Skills, and Social Skill. Below you will see a list of Skills and their types.

### Physical Skills:

Acrobatics, Athletics, Brawn, Equipment, Ride, Stealth, and Vehicle

### Mental Skills:

Crafting, History, Investigation, Logic, Lore, Medicine, and Nature

### Social Skills:

Bluff, Haggle, Handle Animal, Leadership, Performance, Persuasion, and Taunt

#### SKILL CRITICAL SUCCESS

While the roll of a 10 on a Skill Roll does not automatically guarantee success, it is considered a SKILL CRITICAL SUCCESS. Skill Critical SUCCESS adds an additional +5 Bonus to the total Value of the Roll. There is no additional penalty for the roll of a 1 on Skill Rolls. 

In combat, a Skill can be used as a MAJOR ACTION, unless your Character has an ability that lets them use it in another way (see ACTIONS below). Your Weaver determines the consequences and the appropriate difficulty level for the Skill’s use. Your Weaver may call for your Character to use a Skill or you may choose to use Skills outside of combat when the Weaver deems it necessary.

In combat any Creature is considered OPEN if they use a PHYSICAL SKILL in combat. For more information, see Chapter 10: Combat rules: Attacking Openings & Threat Range.

#### SKILL MASTERY

Skill Rolls are typically determined by dice rolls but if a Character is not under pressure from time or other factors such as combat, a Character can automatically succeed in a Skill Roll for which their Skill Modifier is greater than or equal to the DL. This is referred to as SKILL MASTERY / SKILL MASTERY RULE. For example, If the Azag the Dire Orc is moving a fallen tree from the road, the Weaver may determine that the DL to move the tree is DL 5. If Azag’s Modifier for the Brawn Skill Roll is equal to 5, he can move the tree without having to roll a Skill Roll, because of the Skill Mastery Rule However, if bandits come out of the hedges, Azag is now in a pressured situation and does not have the time to move the tree at his own pace and must roll a Brawn Skill Roll to try and move the tree.

### GROUP SKILL ROLLS     

There are many instances where a group of Creatures or Players may want to make a Skill Roll together. For example, several Creatures may try to free a friend who is Trapped under debris, or by all puling of a rope to move a heavy load. Group Skill Rolls can also be used for when every member of a particular group may need to make a Skill Roll, such as in Infiltration Scenarios (See Chapter 9: Adventuring Rules: Circumstance Tarot: Infiltration Missions), to do so have every member that is participating make the Skill Roll. If at least half (rounded up) of the participating members can Meet to Beat the DL of the challenge then the entire group succeeds. If at least half the participating group (rounded up) does not Meet to Beat the DL the Group Skill Roll fails and no (participant is considered successful). Bonus Dice and Penalty Dice are still taken into account in Group Skill Rolls, however they apply only to the particular Creature(s) they concern and not the group as a whole. This thematically represents the group helping each other out and simultaneously representing how group members without those Skills can hold other members back. 

Group Skill Rolls are not used during an ADVENTURE ENCOUTNER. To see more information on Adventure Encounters see Chapter 9: Adventuring Rules: Adventure Encounters.

### THEMATIC SKILLS

Although Kismet comes with a definitive list of Skills (See Below), [[Bk2]](#_msocom_2) it is often that a Character may possess a Skill due to their background or backstory that will not be on their Character sheet per the Character creation process. In this case a Weaver can have a player include a Skill on a Character’s Character sheet as being a Thematic Skill. Using Azag the Dire Orc as an example again, Azag perhaps grew up without much formal education, but would be aware of Dire Orc customs and religious teachings, at least in their most basic forms. Azag is not Proficient in the Lore Skill, but Azag can add Orcish culture to his list of Proficient Skills because thematically it would make sense for him to know this information. In cases like this, simply add the Thematic Skill to their Character sheet and write a note that it is a Thematic Skill.

Thematic Skills should apply specifically, not generally, that is to say that Thematic Skills apply only to the theme that they fit. In our example, Azag has a Thematic Lore Skill for Orcish customs and religion. But he is not Proficient with the Lore Skill and cannot use it outside of applications related to Orcish culture and religion.

When crafting an object, you need to have the Proficiency, appropriate tools, workspace, and a quarter of the full market price of the object in gold pieces for materials. For example, Rarity 5 sword is 100gp, so it would require 25gp to craft. Assuming you have all that, you need to make a Crafting Skill Roll with the DL equal to the Rarity of the object divided by 2 (rounded up, minimum 1 rarity) plus a base of 5. Using the same example above, to create a Rarity 5 sword is a DL 8 (5 base + 3 ((5 Rarity/2 rounded up)). It takes 1 hour per DL to create the object, if you fail the Craft Skill Roll it still takes the full time however you produce an unusable object. The time taken to craft does not need to be continuous and can be broken in 1 hour intervals between any number of days. 

You can also use the Craft Skill to repair an object if your Crafting Field is related to the object enough for it to be feasible for you to repair the object.

This Skill determines the Piloting techniques of the user.  A Successful Vehicle Skill Roll replaces the Vehicles own Statistics when making any Physical Skill Roll the Vehicle could possibly make. 

Creatures can choose to attack you or your Vehicle directly, however Vehicles, being objects, do not have Defenses. Vehicles also do not take Hit Point damage since they are objects, instead they lose Hit Threshold (see Chapter 9: Adventuring Rules: Objects and Hit Threshold for more information). Vehicles can be repaired the same way objects can. 

Vehicle Skill Rolls can also be used in Place of Fortitude Defense Rolls (if you are Proficient in the Vehicle Skill) when setting a Pace (See Chapter 9: Adventuring Rules: Pace for more information). You can gain Proficiency in this skill by taking the _Vehicle Expert_ Common Ability or the _Skilled_ Common Ability. For more information see Chapter 9: Adventuring Rules: Mounts and Vehicles.

## ACTIONS

In Kismet a single TURN (See Chapter 10: Combat Rules) for any Creature, Characters included, has one of each of the Six basic actions, Major, Minor, Movement, Reactions, Free, and Readied Actions.

#### MAJOR ACTIONS 
are large actions, examples are:

using Skills in combat

 Attacking with a Basic Attack

Attempting to Grapple or Grapple a Creature

Aiding an Ally

Interacting with an Object

Guarding / The Guard Action

Using Abilities.

#### MINOR ACTIONS 

happen either in conjunction with Major Actions or are simply swift enough to not interfere with a Major Action. Some examples are drawing and sheathing weapons, switching ammunition types, using equipment, Interacting with an Object, pulling levers, and maintaining CONCENTRATION (See Chapter 10: Combat Rules) and certain abilities.

#### MOVEMENT ACTIONS 

describe the Characters motion in a turn and is usually done together with other actions. A Character can move its entire speed value in tiles on each of its turns or can break up that movement between other actions if it chooses to. Each tile a Creature moves counts as 1 speed, whether the movement is perpendicular, diagonal or vertically (if the Creature can fly or hover or is swimming). Some abilities and Actions use additional tiles of Speed per tile or a portion of a Character’s speed per turn, such as standing from moving through rough terrain, standing from prone, climbing, swimming, or squeezing. (See Chapter 9: Adventuring Rules). A Creature may move through or share space with an ally at no penalty but cannot move through a space occupied by an enemy Creature, but you may be at 0 range of that enemy (sharing space). 

#### FREE ACTIONS

take no resources or meaningful thought on a Character’s part to perform and can be done without interfering in any other actions. Such actions include speaking or thinking.

#### REACTIONS

are actions that can be performed even when it is not your Turn. Each Creature or Player only has one Reaction a per round, and they only regain their Reaction at the start of their next Turn. Reactions usually occur just before the trigger action occurs, for example a Reaction that allows a Creature to defend itself happens as After an Attack or Defense Roll but before that roll is resolved. The Reaction is resolved in its entirety before the trigger Action is completed.

#### READIED ACTIONS 
are delayed Actions that occur on a certain trigger. To do so a Creature gives up its Major Action that turn (the action it readies to perform later) and can use that Major Action as a Reaction when the trigger for that Action occurs. For example, you and an enemy are hiding behind barrels in a shootout. On your turn you cannot see the enemy behind the barrel, so you forgo your Major Action to use as a Reaction when he steps out from behind the barrel. In this case, if the enemy steps out you use your Reaction to make the attack, however if he does not step out (does not trigger your action) then you do not get to use your Readied Action and it is wasted.
