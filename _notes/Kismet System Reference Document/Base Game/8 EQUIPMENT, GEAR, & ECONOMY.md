In this Chapter you will find all of the necessary information regarding weapons, items, and objects in the world of Amarant.

## BASIC ARMOR, WEAPON AND FOCUS RULES

 In Amarant Players and creatures alike will be interacting with the objects in the world around them. Those objects may be weapons, armors, or even mundane items. Mostly, one can expect a Creature or Plyer to interact with any particular object the way one would in real life as well, but there are certain rules to be aware of. An important distinction to be aware of in Kismet is the difference between a HELD object and a WORN object. Worn objects are objects that are actively in a creature’s hands and/or is trying to use for example an unsheathed sword or wearing an Armor. Held objects on the other hand are objects that are on a creature’s person, but not necessarily being actively used.  Examples include a creature’s coin purse, Potions or Ammunitions it has stored in its pockets or a Bag (See below Chapter 8 Equipment, Gear, & Economy: Packs & Bags for more information). A creature generally does not have access to the benefits of a Held Item, where as a creature is actively trying to use the benefits of a Worn item. 

Creatures and Players can access their Held Inventory to make it par to their Worn inventory with a Minor Action in most cases. For example, simply switching weapons requires a Minor Action to sheathe the original weapon and unsheathe the new one; however, a more complicated task such as Donning or Doffing armor will take much longer depending on the armor and may not be done with just a Minor Action.

The Types of Worn equipment are Ammunition, Armors, Base Weapons, Foci, Grenades & Combat Traps, Improvised Weapons, Natural Weapons, Melee Weapons, Ranged Weapons, Siege Weapons, and Unarmed Weapons. Below you will find the Types of Worn Equipment and their Properties if they have any.

### AMMUNITION

Ammunition is any type of projectile that is launched from a Ranged Weapon. Examples include bullets, arrows, bolas, or Thrown Weapons.  For each Creature that is targeted with a Ranged Weapon subtract 1 from the total Ammunition count, regardless of the Attack’s Success.

##### AMMUNITION PROPERTIES

 Below is a list of the Ammunition can have:

<br/> Ascadsdadsafsdgdsdz

RECOVERING AMMUNITION

One can recover their ammunition spent in combat by taking one full minute (6 Rounds if still in Combat) to do so. You always recover half (Rounded down) of the Ammunition spent.

### ARMOR

Armor is protective equipment that is more like clothing, rather than held in hand. Most Armor provides your [[2 CORE RULES#LEVEL|Level]] +1 in Armor Value, while being Unarmored provides only a Value equal to you [[2 CORE RULES#LEVEL|Level]] in Armor Value.

##### ARMOR PROPERTIES

Below is a list of the Properties Armors can have:

**ABLATIVE:** While wearing an Armor with this Property and you are damaged in Combat, you can reduce the Hit Threshold of the Armor up to the amount of damage you took (after subtracting Armor Value). You reduce Damage done on you by the amount of Hit Threshold you reduced. You may do this once per instance you are damaged in. You can reduce your damage to 0 using this Property.

**BREAK OUT:** While wearing an Armor with this Property, you can reduce the Hit Threshold of the Armor by 1 when you are trying to break free of a Grapple/Wrestle (but not during the Initial Grapple attempt). When you do, you can add a Bonus Die to your Defense Roll against the Grapple/Wrestle.

**FLAK PROOF:** While wearing an Armor with this Property, you can reduce the Hit Threshold of the Armor by 1 when you are targeted by a damaging Ability or Effect that you are not the Initial Target of. When you do, you can avoid the Damage done by the Effect or Ability but are still subject to any additional effects if you fail your Defense Roll.

**HEAVY:** When wielding or wearing an object with this Property, you have a -1 to Speed. If you make an unsuccessful Attack Roll against a Creature(s) while using a Weapon with this Property you can Deal 1 True Bludgeoning Damage to a any Creature(s) you Targeted. An Armor with this Property also has an additional +1 Armor Value (Included in Armor Chart), and a Shield with this Property also adds an additional +1 to Defense (Included in Shield Chart)

**INSULATED:** While wearing an Armor with this Property, you gain a bonus die to your Defense Rolls against extreme weather such as heat, cold, storms, wind, etc..

**MAGEMADE:** While wearing an Armor with this Property, you can reduce the Hit Threshold of the Armor by 1 to reduce your DL to Concentrate on an Ability to 7. Abilities or Effects that automatically break your Concentration are not affected by this Property. You are still subject to any damage or additional effects if you fail your Defense Roll.

**MASSIVE:** When wielding or wearing an object with this Property, you have a -2 to Speed. A Weapon with this Property deals +1 Damage compared to the regular Value (Already included in Weapon Chart), an Armor with this Property has +2 Armor Value (Included in Armor Chart) compared to the regular value, and a Shield with this Property adds +2 to Defense (Included in Shield Chart) compared to the regular value.

**NIMBLE:** While wearing an Armor with this Property, you can reduce the Hit Threshold of the Armor by 1 when you are hit with an Opening Attack. When you do, you can continue your turn as if you were not hit by the Opening Attack. You are still subject to any damage or other effects from the Opening Attack.

**STURDY:** Weapons and Objects with this Property have 1 additional Hit Threshold, but also have +1 Encumbrance (Both stats already included in Charts)

## BASE ATTACKS AND DAMAGE

If you fight without using a Weapon and/or Foci, you deal your [[2 CORE RULES#LEVEL|Level]]+4 in Damage, this is known as your BASE DAMAGE. Your Base Damage is the base of any Attack or Ability you use when you don’t have a Weapon or Focus replacing your Base Damage. For example, you don’t need a sword to perform the _Lunge_ Ability, but if you perform it without a sword you only deal [[2 CORE RULES#LEVEL|Level]]+4 in Damage instead of [[2 CORE RULES#LEVEL|Level]]+5 you would get with a sword. You also use the Weapon’s Reach rather than your Unarmed Reach. Same goes for Focus Abilities, you don’t need a Focus to use Focus Attacks (such as Fire magic or Radiant Healing magic), but when you do so you will only deal/heal your [[2 CORE RULES#LEVEL|Level]]+4 in Damage (The Base damage). If you cast a Focus Attack at Base (a Basic Focus Attack), your Range is 1-4 Tiles and your Projectile Type is Standard. (see Chapter 10: Combat Rules: Projectile Types) Similarly your Unarmed Damage, when you make attacks such as with fists, or teeth is also [[2 CORE RULES#LEVEL|Level]]+4, however they are separate attack categories. Similarly, the Reach of Unarmed Melee is Range 0. 

Base Weapon Attacks do not have any additional Properties.

### FOCI

Foci are objects that allow you to channel magical energies into spells or Abilities. A Focus can take many forms, but otherwise function like Ranged Weapons, but they do not need ammunition and have the following Ranges. Base Foci (no focus equipped) 1-4 tiles, One Handed Focus has a Range of 2-8 Tiles, Two-Handed Focus has a Range of 3-12 Tiles. Like Ranged Weapons you have a Penalty Die target a Creature that is closer to you than your minimum Range and using a Focus to make an attack or Ability within a Creature’s Melee Reach leaves you OPEN (see more in Chapter 10: Combat Rules: Attacking Openings & Threat Range). 

##### FOCUS PROPERTIES

Below is a list of the Properties Foci can have:

**ALARMING:** This Weapon makes a tremendous noise when use and can be heard up to 2 Ear Shots (12 Tiles) away

**CALVARY:** When wielding a Weapon or Shield with this Property, you can use the Weapon or Shield in one hand rather than two if it has the Two-Handed Property if you are Mounted, leaving you one free hand to steer your Mount.

**DESTROYER:** When you deal Damage with a Weapon with this Property, you can also choose to damage the Creature's Weapon, Armor, Shield or Object on the creature's person by your Equipped Weapon or Focus’ Hit Value in Hits towards the object's Hit Threshold.

**HEAVY:** When wielding or wearing an object with this Property, you have a -1 to Speed. If you make an unsuccessful Attack Roll against a Creature(s) while using a Weapon with this Property you can Deal 1 True Bludgeoning Damage to a any Creature(s) you Targeted. This effect cannot Damage a Creature that has rolled a Critical Success on its Defense Roll. An Armor with this Property also has an additional +1 Armor Value (Included in Armor Chart), and a Shield with this Property also adds an additional +1 to Defense (Included in Shield Chart)

**HIDDEN:** A Weapon or Shield with this Property allows you to hide the Weapon on your person using a Stealth Skill Roll. This roll is opposed to a creature performing a Perception Defense Roll or an Investigation Skill Roll to search for hidden objects on your person.

**IMPROVED CLEAVE:** When you wield a Weapon with this property, you can target one additional creature when you make an Attack or use an Ability that Cleaves

**MASSIVE:** When wielding or wearing an object with this Property, you have a -2 to Speed. A Weapon with this Property deals +1 Damage compared to the regular Value (Already included in Weapon Chart), an Armor with this Property has +2 Armor Value (Included in Armor Chart) compared to the regular value, and a Shield with this Property adds +2 to Defense (Included in Shield Chart) compared to the regular value.

**MELEE:** When wielding a Ranged Weapon with this Property, you can treat it as a Melee Weapon. its Reach and Damage Type as a Melee Weapon are listed respectively in Parenthesis. The amount of Damage it deals as a Melee Weapon is that same as the regular Damage listed in the Weapon Chart

**MONASTIC:** When wielding a Weapon with this Property, any Abilities or Effects that apply to Unarmed Attacks also apply to this weapon

**PRECISE:** When wielding a Weapon with this Property, you deal an additional +2 Damage when you roll a Critical Success on an Attack Roll. The extra Damage is the same type as the Weapon's regular Damage Type. When wielding a Shield with this Property, you can make Critical Successes on Defense Rolls on a roll of a 9 or 10.

**SPELL WARP:** When you wield a Focus Weapon with this Property you can ignore any Defense Bonuses granted to the creature by it's shield or Cover when making an Attack Roll.

**STURDY:** Weapons and Objects with this Property have 1 additional Hit Threshold, but also have +1 Encumbrance (Both stats already included in Charts)

**TURRET:** When attacking with a Weapon with this Property, the Attack is a Line Area of Affect, you cannot use Abilities that require an Attack Roll with this Weapon

**TWO-HANDED:** In order to Attack or Defend yourself with a Two-Handed Weapon, you need to put both hands on the weapon.

### GRENADES & COMBAT TRAPS

Grenades and portable Traps are common Weapons in Amarant, they are incredibly dangerous but also expensive. Grenades can be thrown as a Major Action and have a Range of 2-6 Tiles and on impact they have an Area of Effect of 1 Tile radius, per Quality from the center. Poor Quality effecting only the Tile they land in, Standard Quality effecting 1 Tile radially, and increasing by 1 Tile in radius for each Quality above Standard. The effect of the blast depends on the type of Grenade. Grenades typically target Dodge Defense as a default, however there are some that target other defenses as well.

Side Note about Grenades: Even if the Attack Roll with Grenades is unsuccessful, the effect of the Grenade still goes off, it simply does not affect the Targeted Creature(s) by Damaging them or by any other effects of the Grenade. However, the environment can still be affected.

 Combat Traps can be laid down in the heat of combat as a Major action. Combat Traps typically target Perception Defense as a default. Combat Traps must be laid down within 1 Tile of you and can only be triggered when something enters its Tile. Like Grenades, Combat Traps have an area of effect equal to their Quality in Tiles radially. It should be noted that a Combat Trap does not function like a regular dungeon Trap. Treat Combat Traps like a Weapon and not like a Dungeon’s Trap (See Chapter 11: Encounter’s, Experience, & Dungeons). 

### IMPROVISED WEAPONS

If you attack with an IMPROVISED WEAPON, such as a chair, pole, or object not made for combat, you deal your [[2 CORE RULES#LEVEL|Level]]+6 for a Melee improvised Weapon, and [[2 CORE RULES#LEVEL|Level]] +5 for a Ranged Improvised Weapon, in the appropriate damage type (typically Bludgeoning). You may throw an improvised weapon as far as 4 tiles away from you. 

Improvised Weapons do not have any Properties but will have a Reach that matches the closest weapon to it. For example, a chair may only have a Reach of 1 Tile, where a Ladder my have a reach of 1-2 Tiles.

Improvised Melee Weapons can still be used to Attack and Opening and have a THREAT RANGE. (see Chapter 10: Combat Rules: Attacking Openings & Threat Range for more information)

### MELEE WEAPONS

Weapons come in a variety of forms, typically a Weapon is either One Handed or Two-Handed, or a Melee, Ranged, or Focus. Melee Weapons are used in close quarters combat such as swords, axes, and maces and do the most Damage. Ranged Weapons are used at a distance, such as bows, and guns do the least Damage. Foci (Singular Focus) are Equipment that are used to channel magical power and do the same Damage as Ranged Weapons. One Handed Weapons but have varying Reach and Properties and Two-Handed Weapons often have more reach than a One Handed Weapon. Many Two-Handed Weapons have the “Improved Cleave” Property which allows the wielder to hit an additional Creature with each attack in Reach. There are many other unique weapons with various ranges and properties.

Note that while any object may occupy a hand, you do not necessarily need a free hand to use an Ability. For example, if you are wielding two swords, even though your hands are occupied by the swords you could still use Focus based Abilities, it will just be at the Base Values for Range and Damage (see below). Similarly having both hands full with a pair of guns does not restrict the use of a Melee Weapon Ability, but its values are taken from the Base Values. An Ability will specifically state if it needs an open hand to use it.

Melee Weapons are unique compared to other Weapons in that they have Melee Threat Range. A Creature can safely enter a Threat Range of a Melee Weapon but cannot move from its position nor escape from the Threat Range without being considered Open. A Melee Weapon’s Threat Range is equivalent to its Minimum and Maximum Reach/Range. For more information see Chapter 10: Combat Rules” Attacking Openings & Threat Range.

##### MELEE WEAPONS PROPERTIES 

Below is a list of the Properties Melee Weapons can have:

**CALVARY:** When wielding a Weapon or Shield with this Property, you can use the Weapon or Shield in one hand rather than two if it has the Two-Handed Property if you are Mounted, leaving you one free hand to steer your Mount.

Shields in Kismet is a broad term for any tools of war used to defend oneself from incoming attacks that are not pieces of Armor.

Shields Provide a +1 Bonus to all of the Creature wielding it’s Defense Modifiers.  Shields are not Weapons and successfully Attacking a Creature with one deals Base Damage in Bludgeoning damage. Having a Shield in one hand and a Weapon in the other is not considered Dual Wielding. A Creature may Dual Wield Shields however, they only gain the Highest Bonus to their Defense Modifiers and the Bonuses to the Defense Modifiers of multiple Shields do not stack. When Dual Wielding Shields a Creature does benefit from having multiple Shield Properties unlike the Bonus to Defense Modifier.

### SIEGE WEAPONS

Siege Engines or Siege Weapons are the tools of warfare and capable of causing massive destruction. They are used to destroy fortresses, defend positions, and lay waste to one’s foes. To use a Siege Engine a certain number of creatures must come together and with several Actions to operate the tool. Siege Engines often require actions to be moved, to load their Ammunition, and to shoot. A creature that is within their Unarmed reach of a Siege Weapon can donate some or all of its Actions (Major, Minor, Movement, etc) to operate the Weapon. The Weapon then Fire, moves, or does the appropriate maneuver at the time the last of the required Actions is donated.  

For example, it takes two creatures to move, load, and shoot a Ballista. If creature A is already within their Unarmed Reach of the same Ballista, creature A can on its turn its Movement Action to donate one Movement Action to the Ballista (1/2 Actions necessary to move).

Since no other creature is close by Creature A also donates its Major Action to Firing the Ballista (1/2 Actions necessary to Fire) and its Minor Action to loading the Ballista (1/2 Actions necessary to load).

 On Creature B’s Turn, it is not Close enough to donate its Actions, so it uses its own Movement Action to get within Unarmed Reach of the Ballista, being now unable to give its Movement Action, creature B Still can Donate its Minor Action to Help Load the Ballista (2/2 necessary Action to load, Ballista is fully loaded), but does not give its Major Action as this would fire the Ballista. 

Next Creature A uses its own Major Action to Fire the Ballista (2/2 Actions necessary to Fire the Ballista).

SIDE NOTE:

Actions do not have to be given in any particular order to operate a Siege Weapons, in the above example creature B could have given its Major Action and not its Minor Action and the ballista would have still fired when it reached all of the Actions required, the last Action being the Minor Action to Load the Ballista.

### SWARMS & SIEGE ENGINES:

Swarms ( See Chapter 10: Combat Rules: Swarm Combat) are a unique type of creature(s) and have the additional property of being able to donate an “Infinite” number of Actions to a Siege Engine if even 1 Tile of the Swarm is within their Unarmed reach of the Siege Weapon.  However, a Swarm that donates Actions to a Siege Engine cannot use those Actions for any other purpose during their Turn.

For Creatures of larger Size than 1 or the Siege Engine they are operating, the larger creatures count as its Size Squared for number of creatures it replicates, for example a Size 2 creature counts as 4 creatures, and a Size 4 creatures would count as 16 creatures, but only for have the Sige Engine take a Movement Action. Creatures of Larger Size do not contribute more Major or Minor Actions to a Siege Engines’ operation.

For Creatures that are smaller than Size 1 or the Siege Engine they are operating, need to donate double the number of Actions per Size Category they are below the Siege Engine to operate it.

For Siege Engines or larger or smaller size than 1, half the number of creatures and Actions required to operate it. 

The Siege Engine Size values that are listed in the Charts below (INSERT CHART) [[Bk11]](#_msocom_11) are scaled to a Size 1 creature. Thus, if a Rampart is a Size 4 (4 Tiles by 4 tiles by 4 Tiles) this is a Rampart intended to be operated by Size 1 Creatures.

Operating a Siege Engine leaves a Creature Open, But often being behind a Siege Engine besides rams can provide situational Cover.

There are many types of Siege Engines and they vary in their power, use, and maneuverability. The types of Siege Engines are as follows:

§  **ARTILLERY:**  Artillery Siege Engines aim to literally rain down destruction onto foes. Usually aimed at opposing troops rather than structures, artillery can obliterate creatures but is not the most effective against structures. Artillery fire also comes down on creatures from the sky, ignoring conventional Cover. Artillery Siege Engines require 4 creature’s Movement Actions to move up to half of the lowest Speed of all creatures. 2 creatures that can both succeed a Brawn Skill Check Roll of DL 7 can move an Artillery Siege Engine by themselves. Artillery Siege Engines requires 2 Minor Action to load and 2 Major Action to fire.

o   4 Movement Actions to move (move the Slowest Creature’s Speed) – DL 7 to move with 2.

o   2 Minor Action to Load the Artillery

o   2 Major Action to Fire the Artillery

§  **BALLISTAE:** Ballistae can be thought of as giant crossbows. While less useful in general to take down structures, Ballistae excel at picking off far away targets, and are excellent at trying to stop flying creatures, or shooting at opposing Siege Engines or creatures trying to operate them. Ballistae Siege Engines require 4 creature’s Movement Actions to move up to half of the lowest Speed of all creatures. 2 creatures that can both succeed a Brawn Skill Check Roll of DL 7 can move an Artillery Siege Engine by themselves. Artillery Siege Engines require 2 Minor Action to load and 2 Major Action to fire.

o   4 Movement Actions to move (move the Slowest Creature’s Speed) – DL 7 to move with 2.

o   2 Minor Action to Load the Artillery

o   2 Major Action to Fire the Artillery

§  **CATAPULTS & TREBUCHETS:** These Siege Engines are designed for the mass destruction of structures, although they are just as deadly to opposing creatures as well. Catapult Siege Engines require 16 creature’s Movement Actions to move up to half of the lowest Speed of all creatures. 8 creatures that can succeed a Brawn Group Skill Check Roll of DL 10 can move an Catapult Siege Engine by themselves. Catapult Siege Engines require 16 Minor Action to load and 16 Major Action to fire.

o   16 Movement Actions to move (move the Slowest Creature’s Speed) – DL 10 to move with 8.

o   16 Minor Action to Load the Catapult

o   16 Major Action to Fire the Catapult

§  **RAMPARTS:** There are Siege Engines that also exist for defense and the holding of key strategic points. Ramparts are Defensive wall and structures that provide Full Cover to creatures behind them. Ramparts are  in general the toughest of structures to destroy. Rampart Siege Engines require 20 creature’s Movement Actions to move up to half of the lowest Speed of all creatures. 10 creatures that can succeed a Brawn Group Skill Check Roll of DL 10 can move an Catapult Siege Engine by themselves. Ramparts often do not have any offense based equipment but if they do, a Rampart Siege Engines require 10 Minor Action to load and 10 Major Action to fire.

o   20 Movement Actions to move (move the Slowest Creature’s Speed) – DL 10 to move with 8.

o   10 Minor Action to Load the Rampart

o   10 Major Action to Fire the Rampart

§  **RAMS:** Rams are perhaps the smallest form of Siege Engine, coming in a standard one-man form (often used by Police or guards) to Military Grade Rams, requiring many more people to operate. For sieging fortresses Ram Siege Engines require 4 creature’s Movement Actions to move up to half of the lowest Speed of all creatures. 2 creatures that can succeed a Brawn Group Skill Check Roll of DL 7 can move a Ram Siege Engine by themselves. Ram Siege Engines require 2 Major Action to fire, that is to hit a creature or object within the Siege’s Melee Range of 2 Tiles.

A ram Siege Engine Does not Threaten and cannot Attack openings.

o   4 Movement Actions to move (move the Slowest Creature’s Speed) – DL 10 to move with 8.

o   2 Major Action to Fire the Ram

§  **SIEGE TOWERS:** dubbed “war cities” or even “City takers’ Siege Towers are truly awesome sights on the battlefield. Also called Belfries, or Siege Towers are portable fortresses that can be used for Defensive or offensive purposes. Many creatures can fit inside of a Siege Tower benefitting from the protection its thick walls, Providing Full Cover, offer while being transported to a more key location. Often teams of archers or smaller Siege Engines sit atop the Siege tower firing at their targets as they close in. Tower Siege Engines require 25 creature’s Movement Actions to move up to half of the lowest Speed of all creatures. 12 creatures that can succeed a Brawn Group Skill Check Roll of DL 15 can move a Tower Siege Engine by themselves. Catapult Siege Engines require 25 Major Action to load and 25 Major Action to fire if they have Siege Weapons on top of them. Creatures placed on top of the Siege engines may fire their own weapons individually but will only receive the benefit of Cover from the Siege Engine and not its other defensive benefits.

o   25 Movement Actions to move (move the Slowest Creature’s Speed) – DL 10 to move with 8.

o   25 Minor Action to Load the Tower

o   25 Major Action to Fire the Tower

Siege Engines can also vary greatly in their use and tactics depending on the Ammunition type they are using. The following are the Ammunition types for Siege Engines

### SIEGE ENGINE AMMUNITION TYPES

§  **CHAIN/NET:** firing strong iron chains or thick weighted nets from a Siege Engine tangles troops, giant sized creatures or clogging up other Siege Engines making them unusable. Creatures, Structures, Siege Engines and creatures that are operating Siege Engines that are successfully hit by this type of Ammunition are Restrained. Needing to beat a DL specific to the Chain/ Net Ammunition (see Chapter X Equipment : Siege Weapon Ammunitions) [[Bk12]](#_msocom_12) to break free of the Restrained condition. Siege Engines that are Restrained are unable to move or to be fired until they are free of the Restrained condition. Siege Engines can be freed of the Restrained condition by having creature’s that are not Restrained use a number of Major Actions specific to the Chain [[Bk13]](#_msocom_13) /Next Ammunition to rid the Siege Engine of the entanglement. Creatures that are not Restrained can Man a Restrained Siege Engine for the purpose of freeing it from its bonds. 

Creatures or Siege Engines that are Flying while restrained Plummet to the ground and take Falling Damage 9 See Chapter 9: Adventuring Rules: Falling Damage for more info) unless they are able to fly without the need to move. 

§  **CHEMICAL FIRE/OIL & FIRE:** These horrific loads slather their foes in corrosive and combustive materials. Creatures or Siege Engines that fial their Defense Rolls from this type of Siege Ammunition automatically receive the Ignite Wound (See chapter 10: Combat Rules: Wounds for more information).  In Addition, the Hit Threshold of the Siege Engines, as well as all Held or Worn inventory also takes the same amount of Hits as the Ignite Damage from this Wound. 

§  **DISEASED:** an Abominable type of Sige Ammunition diseases corpses, or similar substances are launched at the opposing foes. Unlikely to deal much structural damage or inflict heavy wounds, this Siege Ammunition infects those in its Area of Effect and with a potential Disease and lingers for some time. The Disease itself is chosen appropriately by the Type of Ammunition, the Weaver, or as appropriate.  Creatures in the Area of Effect must make a Fortitude Defense Roll on top of other Defense Rolls to avoid the incoming Damage, as a Infection Roll. (See Chapter 9: Adventuring Rules: Diseases & Poisons)

§  **EXPLOSIVE:** designed for maximum destruction Explosive Siege Ammunition uses highly combustible and volatile material to create powerful explosions that rock the foundations for structures and mangle the bodies of their foes. Explosive Siege Ammunition deals extra Hits to Hit Threshold, has a Larger Area of Effect and inflicts the Blown Away Wound on creatures that Fail their Defense Rolls against This Siege Ammunition.

§  **HARPOON:** Harpoons are sued to restrain, catch, or manipulate other creatures or Siege Engines on the battlefield. Creatures that Fail their defense Roll against this kid of Siege Ammunition are Restrained and must meet a DL specific by the ammunition itself to bre free of the Restrained Condition. While restrained in this Manner the operators of the Siege Engine can use a an appropriate number of Minor Actions to operate the Siege Engine, to forcibly moved the restrained structure or creature a number of Tiles equal to the Siege Engine’s Size times 2.

Alternatively, they can use those Actions to instead force the Siege Engine or Creature Prone, This is done by making a Group Brawn Skill Roll against a DL equal to the Creature or Siege Engines Size + 7.

 Creatures or Siege Engines that are Flying while restrained Plummet to the ground and take Falling Damage 9 See Chapter 9: Adventuring Rules: Falling Damage for more info) unless they are able to fly without the need to move. 

§  **LYGHTFYRE:** don’t really remember all the lyghtfyre properties

§  **SPELLWROUGHT:** Spellwrought Sige Ammunition is either enchanted objects or harnessed spell energy contained in some manner that allows it to be used for this purpose. The effects of spells being used in tandem with a Siege Engine has nearly limitless capabilities both offensive and Defensive. For specifics see individual Spellwrought Siege Ammunition for more details, but typical examples include”

·       **Elemental Spells** – used for extra fire power and making Siege Ammunition that much more devastating.

·       **Counter Cast/ Nullifying spells** – to stop spells or spellwrought ammunition from being used. Often lingers for some time.

·       **Healing/ Repairing** – Keeps one’s troops and Siege Engines running in tip top shape, although little can be said for the emotional ramifications of using such spells, however.

§  **ROCKET POWERED:** Rocket powered Ammunition has robust ranges, and highly powerful but more selective penetrating power. Generally sacrificing some Area fo effect for a lot of Hits to Hit Threshold and incredibly Long Ranges.

§  **STONE/DEBRIS:** This type of Siege Ammunition is typical. It is of the Siege Ammunition the most affordable and relatively abundant, and needs little work to make effective.

### UNARMED ATTACKS

Unarmed attacks from Humanoid Creatures count as natural weapons that have a range of 0 and only do base damage (l[[2 CORE RULES#LEVEL|Level]]+4). Unarmed attacks cannot be treated as individual weapons and cannot be used to Dual Wield. Like other weapons they do have Hit Threshold of 3 and can break like any other weapon. Unlike other weapons unarmed attacks can only be repaired by a Medicine Skill Roll.

## DUAL WIELDING WEAPONS & FOCI

You can Dual Wield Weapons or Foci meaning you can hold a One Handed Weapon in each hand and attack with them simultaneously. You can only do this if you are attacking a Creature that is in Range/Reach for both your Weapons. When you Dual Wield you deal the most Damage of the Weapons you are Holding. If you are Dual Wielding Weapons with two different Damage Types, you do both Damage Types but only do one instance of damage. For example, if you wield a fire and cold Foci, you deal “Fire & Cold” damage. If the Creature has RESISTANCE or VULNERABILITY to one of or both the Damage Types you add or subtract 2 from the total Damage (see Chapter 2 Statistics: Resistances, Vulnerabilities, and Immunities). If you are able to wield more than two Weapons such as an additional Natural Weapon, you can still only attack with two of any of your Weapons of your choice at a time. When Dual Wielding Weapons with different Modifiers to Attack, use the value of the Weapon that has the higher attack. When Dual wielding you can benefit from both of the Properties of the held Weapons, Bonus gained from Properties stack if possible, such as twice the Hits to Objects Hit Threshold when Dual wielding two Weapons with the Destroyer property. However, for Properties such as Feint, holding two Weapons such as Feint grants no additional Bonus, but while Dual Wielding one could benefit from Properties such as Feint and an additional Property from the other Weapon. 

Note than one can Dual Wield Shields and would benefit from the Properties of both Shields, however one will not gain cumulative Defense Modifiers, instead the highest Modifier takes precedence as well as the highest Penalties.

## EMPOWERMENTS

Empowerments are any type of enhancement, magical or artificial in nature to an item or piece of equipment. For example, a Rifle can be empowered with the power of magical Fire to deal extra Fire Damage, or a sword can be Empowered with a Lyghtfyre Blade. One can Empower their Equipment or Items themselves (if they have the appropriate Craft Skills and/or Abilities to do so) or they can take it to a Craftsman who may have the Skill to do so, for a fee. Empowerments are specific to certain type of objects, such that Empowerments that are meant for weapons cannot be placed on Armor and Vice Versa.

## EQUIPMENT AND GEAR RULES

### EQUIPABLES

A Creature or Player can only carry and equip so much clothing and items. This is limited not only by your Carrying Capacity but also but the number of items it can wear actively. A Creature or Player can actively wear or keep as part of their Worn Inventory is:

-        2 Weapons (or 1, Two-Handed Weapon)

-        1 Helmet

-        1 Mask

-        1 necklace

-        1 cape/cloak

-        1 Armor / clothing

-        1 pair of gloves/gauntlets

-        2 rings

-        1 belt

-        1 pair of pants/boots/shoes

-        1 pack/backpack

-        3 bags

Any additional equipment or gear is simply not worn actively and in Players or Creature’s Held inventory.

## MOUNTS & VEHICLES

Travelling is a large part of adventuring and typically getting to your destination faster is better. If a Creature can afford or find a mount or vehicle to pilot or be a passenger on, they get the follow benefits; 

A Creature can pilot or be a passenger on a mount or vehicle in order to use its speed rather than their own. 

When setting Pace while mounted or in a vehicle the pilot and any passengers have a bonus die to their Fortitude Defense against Exhaustion from setting pace and can use their Ride Skill or Vehicle Skill Roll instead of a Fortitude Defense Roll.

Pilots and Passengers have a Bonus Die to Melee Attack Creatures smaller than your Mount/ Vehicle in Size. 

See below for specific Mount and Vehicle statistics and more specific rulings for mounts and vehicles.

**Type:** In this context, Type refers to whether the listed item is a Mount or a Vehicle, as different rules may apply to each (See below)

**Size:** Size refers to the total size of the Mount or Vehicle and is the same as Size for Creatures. For example, a Size 2 Mount would take 4 Tiles in space same as a Size 2 Creature. You can only benefit from a Mount or Vehicle that is your size or larger. 

**Hit Points/Hit Threshold:** The number of Hit Points a mount has. Vehicles do not have Hit Points. Vehicles instead use Hit Threshold. You should just have these together so players are always looking in the same place for the value.

**Armor Value:** The Armor Value a mount has, Vehicles do not have Armor Value.

**Speed:** How many Tiles the mount or vehicle can move in one turn. If there are more passengers than the Mount/Vehicle’s seat limit, then the mount/vehicle’s speed is reduced by ½. A Mount or Vehicle cannot carry more than double the normal seat limit, having more than double the normal seat limit in passengers reduces the mount/vehicle’s speed to 0. There may be multiple speeds listed for non-standard movement the mount or Vehicle can make. Mounts can attempt non-standard movement that is not listed on its speed such as squeezing, climbing, swimming, however a vehicle can only attempt non-standard movement if it has a Speed Value for that type of movement. For example, a Boat does not have a land Speed, only a Swim Speed and therefore cannot move on land.  

**Fuel Consumption:** Vehicles must use Fuel to move. Each Vehicle has a Fuel Consumption statistic, that determines how many liters using that vehicle uses per hour.

**Handling:** Each vehicle has a “Handling” value, which determines how much additional Speed it costs a vehicle to make a 90 degree turn. To make a turn less than 90 degrees, half the Handling Value (minimum 1) and double it (minimum 2) to make a 180 degree turn. For example, a particular clumsy vehicle such as a wagon has a Speed of 12 (assuming it has horses) and Handling Value of 4 and a more agile lyfghtfyre Hystur (motorbike), has a Speed of 15 and a Handling value of 2. This means that the wagon can rotate 3 times without moving or can move 8 tiles forward with one 90 degree turn or move 4 tiles and make a 180 degree turn. The Hystur can make a 360 degree turn and still move 7 tiles or it can move 13 tiles and make 1 90 degree turn, etc…Mounts have a handling of 0 and therefore it does not cost them speed to turn during their movement. 

**Seat Limit:** The number of passengers (pilot included) the mount or vehicle can hold before having a speed penalty. Seats are created for Size 1 Creatures, so Creatures of larger Size take up more Seats. A Creature takes up 1 Seat space per Tile it occupies. For example, a Size 2 Creature occupies 4 tiles and would therefore take up 4 Seats, while a Size 3 Creature takes up 9 Tiles and therefore takes up 9 Seats. 

**Hit Threshold:** The number of Hit Threshold damage a Vehicle can take. Mounts do not have Hit Threshold.

**Carrying Capacity:** In this context, Carrying Capacity refers to how much gear the mount or vehicle can hold assuming the number of Passengers does not exceed the Seat Limit. For each Passenger above the Seat Limit reduce the Carrying Capacity by 5 for each Seat/Tile occupied by that extra Passenger. 

**Mount Rules**

Mounts are animals such as horses (but can be any Creature deemed reasonable to Mount by the Weaver) that provide bonuses to travelling and an edge in combat. What you can do with a mount depends on whether you choose to control the Mount or let the mount control itself.

If you control the Mount you use it’s Speed value when moving on your Turn and the Mount cannot take any Actions. If an attack or an Ability that does Damage hits you or your Mount you must make a Ride Skill Roll or Dodge Defense Roll against a DL equal to 5+damage taken after subtracting Armor Value or be thrown off your Mount, landing prone in your current Tile. If your Mount dies or goes Prone you automatically fall off, landing Prone within 1 Tile of the Mount.

If you choose to let your Mount control itself, it moves on its own Turn, using its own Speed and can take Actions that it can normally take (such as attacks or using Abilities).

Creatures can choose to Attack you or your Mount directly, if targeting your Mount, use the Mount’s statistics for Hit points, Defense and Armor Value.

If your roll a Critical Fail on your Fortitude Defense or Ride Skill Roll against Exhaustion from setting Pace your Mount gains the appropriate number of Stages of Exhaustion of the DL of the Pace.
  

**Vehicle Rules**

Vehicles can range from buggies, wagons, chariots, cars, planes, man o’ war ships, boats, and even space craft. Treat a vehicle the same as riding a mount that you control for what actions you can perform on a vehicle. Unless the Vehicle has the _Autopilot_ property, you cannot choose to let the vehicle control itself the way a mount would. 

Vehicles sometimes come with their own armaments and weapons. Any pilot or passenger can use any weapon they are within unarmed reach of. Its common to see Siege weapons on really large vehicles, the rules for using Siege weapons applies like normal on vehicles  
  
Creatures can choose to attack you or your Vehicle directly, however Vehicles, being objects, only have Combat Defense and Attacks or Abilities that would normally target another Defense instead target the Vehicles Combat Defense. Vehicles also do not take Hit Point damage since they are objects, instead they lose Hit Threshold (see Chapter 9: Adventuring Rules: Objects and Hit Threshold for more information). Vehicles can be repaired the same way objects can.

Vehicles cannot move through allies unlike Creatures and or Mounts can. If a Vehicle where to move through a Creatures Tile it becomes a RAM action, see next. 

If your roll a Critical Fail on your Fortitude Defense  or Vehicle Skill Roll against Exhaustion from setting Pace your Vehicle takes Hits against its Hit Threshold appropriate to the DL of the Pace.

### RAMMING WITH VEHICLES & MOUNTS

When a Vehicle or Mount comes into contact with a Creature (ally or enemy) the Creature is potentially injured by a RAM or RAMMING Action. A Ram happens automatically when the space that a Vehicle or Mount occupies shares Tiles with another Creature during the Vehicle’s or Mount’s movement. When this happens the Driver or Rider of the Vehicle or Mount must make a Ride Skill Roll or Vehicle Skill Roll, respectively, against the Dodge Defense of the targeted Creatures. If successful, the Vehicle or Mount is unharmed, and the Rammed Creature takes True Bludgeoning Damage equal to the Size of the Vehicle or Mount it was Rammed with and knocked Prone.  If unsuccessful, the Vehicle takes its own Size in Hit Threshold, and a Mount takes its own Size in True Bludgeoning Damage. Mounts may choose to not Ram allies when they share space for any reason, Vehicles must always Ram any Creature they share space with.

## PACKS & BAGS

 In the world of Amarant, one will have to travel carrying their belongings in addition to the gilded treasures one finds along the way. In Kismet a single Creature may at any time carry 1 Pack and 3 Bags or Satchels to help them carry their burdens. Each of these weighs 1 Encumbrance and even if they are full. (See Chapter 9: Adventuring Rules: Carrying Capacity & Encumbrance for more information).

A Pack is any sort of backpack, or larger capacity portable storage. Packs are capable of storing any matter of item, so long as it does not exceed the Carrying Capacity of the Pack. Packs add to a creatures total Carrying Capacity, for example a Poor Quality Pack adds 5 Carrying Capacity to a creatures Carrying Capacity.

 Sacks, Satchels, or Bags are smaller, easier to access pouches, pockets, or skins that are limited to carrying only a very specific type of item such as Potions or Poisons, or mundane items. Bags have their own Carrying Capacity that is not  included to the Creature’s Carrying Capacity. Items stored in the Bag do not count towards the creatures Carrying Capacity but instead applies to the Bag’s Carrying Capacity. Allowing you to carry multiple items in one bag with only the Bag’s Encumbrance weighing on the Creature’s Carrying Capacity.

 A Quiver is a specific type of Bag solely for storing Ammunition of any kind, such as quivers for arrows, magazines for guns, pellets for slings, Grenadier belts, etc. One can put any type of Ammunition they find in their Quiver, and the Quiver does not need to consist solely of a single type of Ammunition. For example, one could hold one Stack of Bullets for a Rifle and one Stack of Arrows for a bow in the same Quiver. Remember that Ammunition comes in stacks of 20 shots/projectiles for 1 Encumbrance. A Quiver’s Carrying Capacity is essentially the number of Stacks of Ammunition, not the individual count of Ammunition one possesses.

 In General the Carrying Capacity of Poor Quality Packs, and Bags is 5, increase by 1 by each increase in quality, such that: a poor bag is 5, standard 6, fine 7, superior 8, masterful 9, Grand masterful 10 carrying capacity.

Any items that cannot fit inside of a Pack, Quiver, or Bag count towards the Creature or Players’ Encumbrance. One cannot partially fit something into a Pack, Quiver, or Bag in order to gain partial benefits.

## POTIONS & POISONS

Potions are beneficial consumable liquids filled with magic that provide bonuses to aid them on their adventures. Their effects often mimic magic or spells. To drink a single potion is a Major or a Minor Action, and you can benefit from multiple different potions at the same time. Potions of the same kind do not stack with each other, and only the potion with the highest Bonus applies. For example, drinking a potion of Strength of RMD 1 (REMEDIAL TIER 1 see below) would increase your Carrying Capacity by 1 for 24 hours, drinking a second Potion of Strength RMD1 would not stack to give you a Bonus of 2 but would simply refresh the 24-hour duration. However, drinking a Potion of Strength RMD 1 and a Potion of Strength RMD 2 would only give you the benefit of the highest value 2.

A Poison is the antithesis of Potions, it is a substance made to cause harm to the consumer. Poisons comes in two varieties, INGESTED or INJURY based. Ingested poisons must be consumed to be effective. For example, an Ingested Poison that is applied to a dagger will have no effect on the Creature it injures. Ingested poisons take effect immediately upon consumption and the consumer of the Ingested poison must make a Defense Roll (typically Fortitude) to stave off the poison’s effects. Conversely, an Injury based poison will have no effect on a Creature that imbibes it. To apply an Injury based poison to a weapon or focus takes a Minor Action, all weapons, and foci can have poisons applied to them, once applied the next successful attack releases the poison from the weapon or focus and onto the Creature. There are no additional Defense Rolls a Creature needs to make against an injury based poison, and the poison needs to be re-applied to the weapon or focus before it can be used again. Poisons use a LETHALITY TIER (LTH) instead of a Remedial Tier like Potions (see below).

## RARITY

 Rarity is a way of finding equivalent wealth for objects within Kismet. Mostly a tool for Weavers, who may need to come up with the value of an object or purchase on the fly, but also very valuable for Player Characters looking to sell their valuables for a good price. Amarant, the base setting of Kismet uses a Gold and Silver Coin currency Silver being the most common currency used and the exchange of Silver to Gold being 20: 1, and the Ratio of Gold to Rarity is also 20:1. (meaning the ratio of Rarity to Silver is 1:400).  Below you will find a chart that quickly gives the conversions for certain Levels of Rarity.

The maximum amount of Rarity an object that could be worn in Held Inventory (Weapons, Armors, Potions etc.) can be is Rarity 60. Beyond Rarity 60 are objects or great Size or value such as large ships, castles, homes, and more.

## REMEDIAL & LETHALITY TIER

A Tier of Remedial/Lethality (RDM/LTH) (See the Difficulty Tier Table below ) determines just how potent a poison or potion is. The higher the tier, the stronger it is at healing/harming. A potion or poison’s remedial or lethality tier is equivalent to its Rarity level. Typically to undo the effect of a poison or disease, you need a cure that is at least equal to or greater than the lethality level of the poison or disease. The price of many of the poison’s are black market prices as most lawful vendors won’t sell them (except in area’s where poison can be bought for research purposes). In the list below the consumables show what level of RDM/LTH the consumable can be. 

The Difficulty Tier Table is once again shown below presents the DL to identify and to stave off the effects of a poison or disease. As mentioned above you only make a Defense Roll against an Ingested poison, not against an Injury based poison.

## RE-SIZING EQUIPMENT

 Not all equipment is one Size fits all in Kismet, while only there are only minor differences between creatures of similar Size Values, such as a Svelte Wild Elf trying to Squeeze into a Hefty Draconian Heavy Plate, there is no penalty as the Armor is still made for a Size 1 creature. However, a creature cannot wear Armor that is not its same Size Value, for example a Wild Orc with a Size of 1 could not fit into a Size ½ Dwarven Plate nor a Size 2 Ogre’s Chainmail.  Because of this the option to go to a craftsman and Re-Size a piece of equipment is doable, for a price.  

The Price of any Equipment is Multiplied by a Creature’s Size Value above 1, squared. Such that a Size 2 Great Sword has x4 the cost of a Size 1 Great sword and a Size 3 would be x9 the cost. If one were to try to increase the Size of an existing object simply subtract the original Value from the New Size’s total cost.

Using any Consumable Item, Such as Potions or Poisons requires a total dosage of the Creature’s Size above 1, squared. Such that a Size 2 Creature would need x4, Size 1 Potions of Healing to receive any Benefit, and a Size 3 Creature would need x9 Size 1 Potions. 

Side Note: Unlike Armor, a creature can attempt to hold a Weapon of any Size value, so long as they can hold it in their Carrying Capacity without being Over-Encumbered, however making Attacks or using Abilities with a Weapon that is any Size category smaller or larger than your own is done with a Penalty Die. Any Successful Attacks made with incorrectly Sized Weapons still deal Damage and Damage types as if you were wielding a correctly Sized Weapon. For example a Size 1/2 Goblin wielding a Size 1 Great Sword would still deal its [[2 CORE RULES#LEVEL|Level]] +5 in Slashing Damage, but would make Attack Rolls with a Penalty Die.                                                                                                              

## WEALTH

### LOOT TABLES

## EQUIPMENT, GEAR, & ECONOMY ANCILLARY: ARTIFACTS

Artifacts are powerful and often ancient relics, usually far beyond the ken of mortals in both power and knowledge. Artifacts generally exist as a single instance in the World of Amaranth and owning one could make any mortal a king, or even powerful enough to begin to rival gods, if they can handle the power. ……..
