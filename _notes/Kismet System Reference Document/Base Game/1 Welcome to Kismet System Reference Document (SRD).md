## SETTING 

Kismet is a table top role playing game, which means that at its heart the world and its setting are as unlimited as one’s imagination and creativity are. However, Kismet does have a base setting for those wishing to explore and discover it. Kismet’s base setting takes place on a planet called Amarant. The world of Amarant is one of discovery and wonder, featuring a variety of magic and sciences along with fantastical and horrific Creatures and landscapes. In the universe of Kismet all things have an origin, a primordial source from which all related articles stem from. The first of anything is the most powerful and ancient of all its descendants. All objects, people, Creatures, land, and matter are all connected by the threads of fate to the first of their kinds.

Before the firsts of anything came to be, the universe existed in an age forgotten. Long before the age of creation, was the nether. Nothing truly existed in the nether except for the nether gods, ancient eldritch horrors which some still believe exist. Then came the age of creation, the first building blocks of the universe came into being. These are the primordial gods, elemental and draconic gods of the first era. These first elementals were so powerful that their interactions formed the world and universe around them. These gods still exist and are worshipped to this day, such as Ignus, the first flame or Illustratum, the first thought.

From the worlds created by the primordial gods, races and species began to form, and a few of those mortals ascended into godhood through an intense trial that none but the god themselves remember. In their newfound power the new godheads known as ascendant gods created their own homes, planets; and created races that would worship them and promote their ideals. The core races (along with other less populous races) Humans, Elves, Dwarves, Orcs, Seelie, and Draconians were created on their respective planets. A series of catastrophic events on each planet caused the races to be transported, one way or another, to the planet of Amarant. With thousands of years upon years of trade, war, and interaction between the races, they soon forgot their origins, making out their home planets to be magical realms that they once descended from.

Each race has tried its best to remake their homes on Amarant, some have succeeded where others have not.  The races try to live and thrive in the world of Amarant, but as much wonder as there is, there are many dangers. The races of the world protect themselves by metaphorically tapping into different sources of power such as Martial Power, Elemental Power, or Psychic Power. There are currently 10 defined sources of power, but in a world as vast and mystical as Amarant who knows what other sources of power can be found. The power sources are wells of knowledge, training, and innate power that any sapient Creature can tap into to perform amazing abilities. Any race can learn any Ability from any of the Power Sources with training or with their own natural talents. All races and beings in Kismet have wells of every power source deep within them and can draw from any of them evenly at anytime, but the extent to which they can metaphorically draw powers from these wells determines whether or not they can perform special abilities. A commoner at most could access the well of elemental magic in them to warm their fingertips with the power of fire, but a person with more aptitude and training such as a Hero (Player Character) could perform feats like shooting jets of flames from their finger tips. The known powers sources are listed below:
