These are the rules used to explore and discover the in the world of Amarant. In here a Weaver or Player can find rules about setting pace, environmental hazards, and social encounters to name a few. 

## ADVENTURE ENCOUNTERS

Players may find themselves in situations that are dangerous or where failure has severe consequences but not be in a Combat Encounter. Solving a riddle door, climbing a treacherous mountain or proving their innocence in the court of law are all examples of a type of Encounter called an **ADVENTURE ENCOUNTER**. Adventure Encounters test a Character’s Skills and ability to react to their environment and are often dangerous either physically, mentally or socially. In order for an Encounter to be considered an Adventure Encounter it needs to meet the following criteria: the task/goal cannot be simply solved by a single dice roll and the Encounter poses some type of threat, hindrance or significant consequence if failed. Haggling with a merchant can be done with a single Persuasion Skill Roll and does not have a significant consequence if you fail to haggle with the merchant and therefore is not an Adventure Encounter. However, convincing the Merchant Guild to reduce their taxation of foreign merchants is more complicated, you may have to go through several layers of bureaucracy and even death threats from higher ranking members and failure could mean ruining a town economically, this is an example of an Adventure Encounter. 

**Set up & Rules for an Adventure Encounter**

An Adventure Encounter, like a Combat Encounter, uses Initiative, Turns and Rounds and Circumstances Boons and Banes (See XXXXX) apply like normal. Each Round, Players (and any opposing factions) draw initiative and take their Turn using any available Actions to do something they feel contributes to the Encounter. Typically making a Skill Roll or using their Abilities (that the Weaver deems appropriate) in order to get a certain number of successful rolls before they get 3 failed rolls. Like Combat Encounters, each Round in an Adventure Encounter is its own scene, however unlike Combat Encounters Rounds don't necessarily take 10 seconds, but rather they take as long as needed for each of the Actions the Players take. For example, looking for clues in a room might take 10 minutes or writing a forgery might take 30 seconds, but following directions on a treasure map might take days or even months of travel.   

**Side note: Initiative & Competing factions in Adventure Encounters**

Initiative in an Adventure Encounter does not need to be strict as it is in a Combat Encounter, although it should still be drawn for Circumstances Boons and Banes. Unless there are competing factions in the Encounter, Players can simply choose which order they go in, drawing Initiative Tarot cards for Circumstance Boons and Banes at the start of their turn. In a scenario where there is a competing faction, such as the Players and a rival party are racing to be the first to find a magical jewel in a maze, Initiative should be drawn as if it were a Combat Encounter for both sides. Opposing creatures get their own Turn in the Initiative order and can use their Turns to make Skill Rolls the same way Players do. In the case of competing Factions, whichever side is the first to reach the required number of successes (See Progress Successes below) wins the Adventure Encounter. It is possible that one faction completely fails (See Progress Fails below) before the other faction, but that does not necessarily mean the remaining faction wins by default, The remaining faction may still need to make all the required Progress Successes in order to win based on the Weaver’s discretion. 

## Encounter Progress and Progress Successes & Fails

A successful Skill Roll earns the players a **PROGRESS SUCCESS** while a failing Skill Roll earns the players a **PROGRESS FAIL**. This process of getting Progress Successes and Progress Fails is tracked through **ENCOUNTER PROGRESS.**  Encounter Progress is a tally of Progress Successes and Progress Fails, the Players beat the Adventure Encounter when they reach the required number of Progress Successes before they reach 3 Progress Fails. The number of Progress Successes needed to win the Adventure Encounter is determined by the Difficulty Tier of the Adventure Encounter (see the Difficulty Tier Table). For example, a Moderate Adventure Encounter requires that 9 Progress Successes are acquired before 3 Progress Fails, with each Skill Roll being rolled against a DL of 9. All Difficulty Tiers (except Extremely Easy) allow only 3 Progress Fails to be earned in order to lose the Adventure Encounters. 

On a Skill Roll that is a Critical Success, in addition to the +5 normally granted from Critical Success on a Skill Roll, Players earn one extra Progress Success, but still only get one Progress Boon (see Progress Boons and Banes below). 

If the player should roll a Skill Roll that is a Critical Success and still not meet or beat the DL required, they earn one Progress Fail from failing the Skill Roll and one Progress Success from the extra Progress Success from the Critical Success. Since the Skill Roll failed, they still get a Progress Bane, they do not get a Progress Boon for getting the extra Progress Success.  

Conversely, a Skill Roll that is a Critical Fail earns you two Progress Fails, but still only one Progress Bane.

 If the Player should roll Critical Fail on their Skill Roll and still manage to meet or beat the DL, then they earn one Progress Success and one Progress Fail. In this case they earned the Progress Success so they still get a Progress Boon, even though they got an extra Progress Fail.

In an Adventure Encounter, the players cannot make Group Skill Checks (see Chapter 2: Playing, Role Playing & Statistics: Group Skill Rolls for more information.) as each Character needs to find a way to individually contribute to the Encounter. Characters are still able to take any actions they normally could however, such as making Attack or Defense Rolls, Aiding other players, Drinking potions etc…  

**Progress Boons & Banes**

Each Progress Success made by the Players using a Skill Roll not only gets them closer to winning the Adventure Encounter, but also gives them a **PROGRESS BOON**, which depending on the Skill used could provide a significant benefit (See Favorable and Unfavorable Skills below). However, each Progress Fail made by the Players gives them a **PROGRESS BANE**, which may hinder their chances of getting a Progress Success. Progress Boons & Banes are determined by the Skill’s Favourability and, unless otherwise stated, remain until they are removed with the _Recovery_ Progress Boon or until after the Adventure Encounter (see the Progress Boon & Bane Table below). Abilities may be used in place of a Skill to get a Progress Success in certain scenarios, for example using the _Organize_ Ability might help speed up a search for documents and therefore is the equivalent of a successful Investigation Skill Roll. When Abilities are used in this way, they always count as successful and count towards the Encounter Progress as a Progress Success but they do not give Progress Boons out the way a Skill Roll does. Circumstance Boons and Banes apply normally and do not count towards Progress Successes or Fails. 

Keeping in mind, if the required number of Progress Successes are made before 3 Progress Fails, then all the Players succeed in their Adventure Encounter and achieve their goal regardless of success in the Encounter Progress. However, any Player that caused one or more Progress Fails suffers from a **SET-BACK** (see below) after the Adventure Encounter is concluded. The Player only suffers one Set-back after an Adventure Encounter and cannot get more than one Set-back per Adventure Encounter.  If 3 Progress Fails are reached before the required number of Progress Successes, then all the Players failed to achieve their goal and must all suffer the consequences of failing (which are determined by the Weaver) along with each player getting a Set-Back. If a player would already get a Set-back from getting a Progress Fail and then the players lose the Adventure Encounter, the player does not get a second Set-back, but the other players who did not have Set-backs get Set-backs.

**Favorable and Unfavorable Skills**  
  
  

In addition to the Difficulty Tier, Adventure Encounters have a set of listed **FAVORABLE SKILLS, NEUTRAL and UNFAVORABLE SKILLS**. Favorable Skills are Skills that most fit or are the most helpful and Unfavorable Skills are those that are least helpful. While any Skill can be used in any Adventure Encounter (See Using any Skill Side Note), certain Skills are going to be more useful in different Adventure Encounters. For example, when climbing a mountain, Athletics, Brawn, and Acrobatics are going to be Favorable while all Social Skills are going to be Unfavorable as they would be the least helpful. Using a Favorable Skill reduces the DL of the Skill Roll necessary by 2, while using an Unfavorable Skill increases the DL by 2. In a Moderate Adventure Encounter, the DL is 9 for most skills, 7 for Favorable Skills and 11 for Unfavorable Skills. Neutral skills are skills that are moderately helpful but not ideal, using these skills have no bonus or penalty associated with them. An advantage that Unfavorable Skills have over Favorable skills is the Progress Boon is greater than the Progress Boon received from a Favorable Skill. From the table below, one can see that Favorable Skills are low risk, low reward, Neutral Skills are moderate risk, moderate reward and Unfavorable Skills are high Risk, high reward.  
  
  

**SIDE NOTE: Using any Skill**

Regardless of whether a Skill is Favorable, Neutral or Unfavorable, any Skill can be used on a Player’s Turn in any Adventure Encounter, as long as the Skill can be justified. For example, in the earlier example of Players proving their innocence in court, the History Skill could be used to find a bylaw or loophole that should let them go free, but it would be difficult to justify using the Brawn Skill to help in this scenario unless the Player can come up with a creative and appropriate use for the Skill, such as using Brawn to show off your muscles in an attempt to flirt with or threaten the judge. The Weaver would determine if that particular use is appropriate or not. Weavers should use their discretion to determine whether a Skill use is appropriate to the Adventure Encounter, if it is not, the Player needs to use a different Skill.

### PROGRESS BOOMS & BANES TABLE

| **Skill Type** | **Progress Boon**        | **Description**                                             | **Progress Bane**            | **Description**                                         |
| -------------- | ------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| Favorable      | _Inspiring Effort_       | Next Skill Roll made by you or an ally gets a +1 Bonus      | _Demoralizing Effort_        | Next Skill Roll made by you or an ally has -1 Penalty   |
| Neutral        | _Recovery_               | Remove a Progress Bane from you or an ally                  | _Tough luck_                 | Remove a Progress Boon from you or an Ally              |
| Unfavorable    | _Surprisingly effective_ | Get 1 additional Progress Success or Remove 1 Progress Fail | _Unsurprisingly ineffective_ | Remove one Progress Success from the Encounter Progress |


**Set-Backs** 

A Set-Back is a Difficulty Tier appropriate Bane caused by making a Progress Fail during the Encounter Progress and is explained by mishaps that happen during the Adventure Encounter. For example, while climbing a mountain (in this case a Moderate Adventure Encounter), Azag the Dire Orc fails one of his Athletics Skill Rolls and therefore slides down a portion of the mountain, now having to climb that distance again. For this Progress Fail he receives the Set-Back of 3 stages of Exhaustion after the Adventure Encounter is won or lost. If Progress Fails are removed (through the _Surprisingly Effective_ Progress Boon for example) then Set-backs are not imposed on the player that caused the Set-back. Exhaustion is the most common and typical Set-Back, however the Weaver is able to apply other Banes as a Set-back (see Set-Back Table below) as long as they are appropriate to the environment and Adventure Encounter. For example, in the Adventure Encounter where the Players must cross a dangerous swamp, getting Poisoned or Diseased as a Set-back would be appropriate, or perhaps the Players are wandering through a mystic landscape and get lost, getting Cursed in this environment as Set-back would be appropriate as well.

Instant death should not be used except for extremely dangerous circumstances*

**Social Adventure Encounters**

Some Adventure Encounters are purely social, for example trying to convince a king’s advisor that a nearby kingdom needs aid is an Adventure Encounter where your goal and activities are almost entirely social. In cases like these, use the Passive Social Defense of the person/creature the Players want to persuade them, instead of using the appropriate DL. Additionally, choose only 1 Social Skill for both the Favorable and Unfavorable Skills, as only Social Skills will be used. The remaining Social Skills will be Neutral Skills. The Favorable and Unfavorable Skills chosen should reflect the characteristics of the person the Players want to persuade and unlike in other Adventure Encounters, the Favorable and Unfavorable Skills may not be initially known to the Players. If they are talking to a stranger or someone, they do not know well it's not likely that they will know what Social Skills are Favorable to them. Players might know what makes their local tavern keep tick as they see him every day, but having not met the king before, would not know what the king likes to hear. For example, a gruff war veteran might not take kindly to flattery (Bluff) but appreciates inspiring speeches (Leadership), whether the Players know this or not depends on how much interaction they have had with the war veteran before. Weavers should use their discretion to determine if the Favorable and Unfavorable Social Skills are known to the players in a Social Adventure Encounter.

In a Social Adventure Encounter, a Difficulty Tier should still be assigned to determine the Encounter Progress and appropriate Boons, Banes and Set-Backs. Using the earlier example with the gruff war veteran; the veteran is a Dwarf whom the Players are trying to convince to work together with an old rival of his. The Dwarf’s Social Defense is 4 and the Weaver has deemed this Adventure Encounter to be a Difficulty Tier of Average. The Weaver has determined that the Dwarf’s Favorable Skill is Leadership (Inspire) and Unfavorable is Bluff (Flattery) but the Weaver does not inform the Players of which Skills are Favorable or Unfavorable as the Players have only met him once before. Therefore the Players need to make 6 Progress Successes before making 3 Progress Fails with the DL of each roll being 9 (4 Social Defense +5) without knowing which Social Skills are Favorable or Unfavorable.   

**Side Note: Set-Backs for Social Adventure Encounters**

Many Adventure Encounters are purely social in nature and therefore do not necessarily pose a physical threat to the Players. In cases like these, Exhaustion may still be a viable set-back if the social encounter was particularly stressful, but if Exhaustion does not feel appropriate the Weaver can come up with a non-standardized but appropriate Set-back such as the locality being hostile to Players, increasing prices with merchants, being stalked, having a mob form against them, being thrown in prison, etc… 

**Adventure Encounters and Scene Flow**

Running an adventure encounter does not have to be continuous between its Rounds and Turns, however it always comes to an end when the players reach the total number of Progress Success required or 3 Progress Fails. For example, in an Adventure Encounter where the players are trying to find a Lich’s phylactery (an object that houses the lich’s soul), the first few rounds might be spent trying to find information on where the phylactery might be, then the next few about traveling to the location, before finally arriving and find the phylactery.  During each of those scenes different Circumstances, Combat Encounters, or even other smaller Adventure Encounters (such as navigating through a mystic forest maze that stands in the path to the phylactery) can occur while the Adventure Encounter Progress is being tracked. During such scenes, unless the players are actively using skills to specifically make Progress in the Adventure Encounter, the Skills, Abilities and Rolls made do not count towards Progress Success or Progress Fails. In addition, any actions taken outside of the Adventure Encounter do not speed up or slow down (that is count as Progress Successes or Fails) the players reaching their Adventure Encounter goals. Even after the players find the location of the phylactery, pass through the mystic forest maze, fight off the phylactery’s guardians, and come into the Lich’s chambers, but only have 9/12 required Progress Successes, they still do not complete their goal of finding the phylactery until they get the 12th Progress Success. The final goal of an Adventure Encounter is only complete when the players reach the total required number of Progress Successes and therefore it cannot be completed regardless of what actions are taken by the players, until they reach that number of Progress Successes. The Weaver will need to create and often improvise additional obstacles that the party must overcome to get Progress success necessary. 

These improvised obstacles should feel natural, realistic, and challenging and should not downplay successful Rolls from the players. Improvising that the mountain is actually higher than they players thought it was is a weak, unchallenging obstacle that adds no depth to the story or danger the players are in, or improving that an avalanche is caused when the players reach that point would mean that the player’s last successful Roll was down played because their successful roll elad to a negative consequence. A better way to improvise an obstacle here might be that upon reaching this peak, the player’s keen senses find that a thick fog has hidden the true top of the mountain, leading many to believe they had made it to the top when they hadn't. However they can also see a treacherous slope leading to the true zenith. This gives the players a sense of success from their last roll as they were not penalized and made a discovery, but also got two new obstacles to overcome (the fog and the slope). 

 Continuing the example mentioned earlier, the Weaver had planned that the phylactery was in this tower and in this room, so all the Progress Successes made by the players led them here, however, the Weaver did not have any additional obstacles planned past finding the phylactery in this room. As the players have 9/12 Progress Successes, so 3 more Successes are needed before they can truly claim their prize. This means 3 more obstacles need to be improvised for the players to overcome. The Weaver tells the players that when they reach to grab the phylactery, it is actually an illusion, and thus the players use whatever Skills or Abilities are at their disposable to find the real Phylactery. Once they hit the 12th Progress Success, they finally find the phylactery. If they reach 3 Progress Fails before getting 12 Progress Successes, then they fail to find it and suffer any Set-Backs they would get from this Adventure Encounter and may need to run another Adventure Encounter to find the phylactery.

**Running a Combat Encounter during Adventure Encounter** 

Its possible to have both a Combat Encounter and an Adventure Encounter happening at the same time. Such a scenario might be that the Players and a rival party have arrived at a temple where you race to be the first to complete a magic ritual. On Player and enemies Turns, they can use their Actions to fight like normal or try to earn Progress Successes, for example, Azag the Dire Orc uses his Major Action to make a Lore Skill Roll to activate the ritual (contributing to the Encounter Progress) and uses his Minor Action to use his _Aura of Flame_ Ability to Damage anyone that comes near him. In scenarios like these, where both a Combat and an Adventure Encounter are happening at the same time, there can be many different outcomes, such as Players winning the fight but losing the Adventure Encounter which may make for more interesting plot or character development, but it also makes a lot more work for Players and the Weaver during to Encounter to track the Circumstances, Combat abilities, Progress Boons/Banes etc… be aware that these Encounters will take longer and require more organization than regular Encounters. 

**Running a Combat Encounter as an Adventure Encounter**

For some groups, the complexity of Combat Encounters can slow down the game or are simply not as enjoyable for them. Consider running your Combat Encounter like an Adventure Encounter as an alternative, narrative focused approach to combat rather than a tactical strategy game. With this approach to combat, a good practice is to create a number of goals for the Players to achieve in the fight, each goal completed is a Progress Success, and each time they attempt to, but fail, to complete that goal it's a Progress Fail. The goals can be completed either by using Abilities, Skills or possibly making Attack Rolls, all of which can give  Progress Boons/Banes as deemed appropriate by the Weaver. In place of Hit Points or Damage, you can use Set-Backs to determine when or if Wounds, Death or other tragedies happen. Examples of such goals are below, each completed goal counts as 1 Progress Success. Using 1 goal per Difficulty Tier of the Adventure Encounter is a good way to provide a heavy stakes narrative combat. 

·        Rescue a number of Hostages or hostage squads. Each hostage or squad each worth 1 Progress Success.

·        Cripple a powerful weapon/ritual by disabling a number of points equal to Difficulty Tier. Each point weakened is worth 1 Progress Success

·        Take out or capture the main leader or a number of captains equal to Difficulty Tier. Each Capitan is worth 1 Progress Success.

·        Trick your enemies into triggering nearby Traps

·        Reach a safe point on the map before the enemies can get you

Stall until reinforcements arrive

·        Distract or Hide from enemies so that you can sneak past them

·        Disarm the enemies of their weapons/natural abilities so they cannot fight back

·        Find an object/magic/machination that gives you an advantage in the fight (such as a legendary sword, a special poison or a powerful mount, etc…)

·        Defeat a creature by attacking it successfully. The Creature has its Tier of Power in “hits” it can take before it is unable to fight/dies.

| **Circumstance**       |                  **Infiltration**                   |
| ---------------------- |:---------------------------------------------------:|
| **Difficulty Tier**    |               **3 (Moderate), DL 11**               |
| **Progress Success**   |                       **0/9**                       |
| **Progress Fail**      |                       **0/3**                       |
| **Favorable Skills**   |        **Physical Skills (except Medicine)**        |
| **Neutral Skills**     |      **Mental Skills (Except Nature), Bluff**       |
| **Unfavorable Skills** | **Social Skills (except Bluff), Medicine, Nature,** |
|                        |                                                     |


 **Azag’s Turn:**  The Player draws Circumstance Tarot and gets 15: the Devil but receives no Circumstance Boon or Bane, Azag figure’s his first order of business is to put his massive muscles to work and bend the bars so that Giles and him can squeeze out. Azag rolls a Brawn Skill roll of 4, with his +5 Brawn Skill Modifier, the total is 9. Normally this would fail but since Brawn is a Favorable Skill, the DL is reduced from 11 to 9, so Azag’s Skill Roll is successful, and they earn a Progress Success and the Inspiring Effort Progress Boon (adding +1 to Giles next Skill Roll). 


 **Giles’ Turn:**  The Player draws a Circumstance Tarot and pulls 7: the Chariot, giving the Must have been the Wind Circumstance boon. Giles decides his best course of action is to hide so no guards can’t find him if they hear the commotion. Giles makes a Stealth Skill Roll and rolls a 2. This is really low, but he adds his +5 from his Stealth Skill Modifier, and another +1 from Inspiring Effort Progress Boon for a total of 8 which is still not enough. Fortunately his Must have been the Wind Circumstance Boon lets him add a Bonus Die, on which he rolls an 8, giving him a total of 16, more than enough to succeed. Another Progress Success is added and for using a Favorable Skill Giles gets the Inspiring Effort Progress Boon which Azag can benefit from next turn.


#### ROUND 2

|    **Circumstance**    |                  **Infiltration**                   |
|:----------------------:|:---------------------------------------------------:|
|  **Difficulty Tier**   |               **3 (Moderate), DL 11**               |
|  **Progress Success**  |                       **2/9**                       |
|   **Progress Fail**    |                       **0/3**                       |
|  **Favorable Skills**  |        **Physical Skills (except Medicine)**        |
|   **Neutral Skills**   |      **Mental Skills (Except Nature), Bluff**       |
| **Unfavorable Skills** | **Social Skills (except Bluff), Medicine, Nature,** |

**Azag’s Turn:** player draws Circumstance Tarot and gets 1: the Magician. This has no Circumstance Boon or Bane associated with it in this Circumstance. Azag knows that guards will have heard the ruckus and knows he is not great at being sneaky, so he decides the next best option is to make the guards back down and try to walk out of here. He shouts loudly “I am Azag the Mighty, anyone who gets in my way i'll gut like a pig and send your bacon back to your mother!” He makes an Intimidate Skill Roll rolling a 6, adding his +5 Intimidate Skill Modifier and +1 from Inspired his value is 12, normally this would have been enough to beat DL 11, but since he is using an Unfavorable Skill the DL is 13 and he fails. They get a Progress Fail and the Unsurprisingly Ineffective Progress Bane, removing one of their Progress Successes. Heavily armed guards storm in and see a lone unarmed dire orc and are not intimidated 

**Giles' Turn:** Player draws Circumstance Tarot and gets 12: the Hanged Man, this has no Circumstance Boons or Banes in this Circumstance. Giles, hidden from the guards, sees that Azag has once again got himself in a sticky situation and will need all the help he can get. Giles uses his _Conjure Trick_ Ability to quickly distract the guards, giving Azag and himself time to escape. This adds Progress Success but does not give any Progress Boons.

#### ROUND 3

|    **Circumstance**    |                  **Infiltration**                   |
|:----------------------:|:---------------------------------------------------:|
|  **Difficulty Tier**   |               **3 (Moderate), DL 11**               |
|  **Progress Success**  |                       **2/9**                       |
|   **Progress Fail**    |                       **1/3**                       |
|  **Favorable Skills**  |        **Physical Skills (except Medicine)**        |
|   **Neutral Skills**   |      **Mental Skills (Except Nature), Bluff**       |
| **Unfavorable Skills** | **Social Skills (except Bluff), Medicine, Nature,** |

**Azag's Turn:** Still at 2 of 9 needed Progress successes (after losing a Progress Success and earning one back) and now at 1 of 3 Progress Fails, the Player draws another Circumstance Tarot 3: the Empress, which has neither a Circumstance Boon or Bane for Azag in this Circumstance.  Azag knows they are in trouble, so he has to do what he does best, go big or go home (or in this case, prison). Azag grabs a nearby chair and tries to threaten the guards one more time “I will break every bone you have and use your limp body as my belt!” he screams, waving the chair around violently. Azag makes another Intimidate Skill Roll, and with luck on his side he rolls a 10, a Critical Success on the Skill Roll. He adds the roll of 10, +5 from the Critical Success Skill Roll Bonus, +5 from his Intimidate Skill Modifier for an incredible value of 20. This beats the DL 13 Unfavorable Skills have and thus is a Progress Success. Azag earns a second Progress Success for rolling a 10 and for his Progress Boon _Surprisingly Effective_ he chooses to earn yet another Progress Success for a total of 3 Progress Successes. The guards are suddenly a lot more afraid of Azag and worried about the structural integrity of their bones should they fight him.

**Gile's Turn:** The Player draws the Circumstance Tarot and gets 6: the Lovers, which has no Circusmtance Boons or Banes in this Circumstance. Giles sees that Azag’s luck has turned around and starts looking for a way out without being followed. He could use Stealth again but then Azag would get left behind. Then Giles has a brilliant idea, he is going to run past the control room and lock down the cell area so the guards cannot follow Azag and himself out. Giles makes a Logic Skill Roll to use the electronic systems. Giles Rolls a 7, +5 Logic Skill Modifier for a total of 12, which is enough to beat the DL 11 as Logic is a Neutral Skill in this Adventure Encounter. Giles adds a Progress Success and takes advantage of the _Recovery_ Progress boon to remove the Progress Bane _Unsurprisingly Ineffective_ from Azag, restoring the lost Progress Success for a total of 2 Progress Successes.

#### ROUND 4

|    **Circumstance**    |                  **Infiltration**                   |
|:----------------------:|:---------------------------------------------------:|
|  **Difficulty Tier**   |               **3 (Moderate), DL 11**               |
|  **Progress Success**  |                       **7/9**                       |
|   **Progress Fail**    |                       **1/3**                       |
|  **Favorable Skills**  |        **Physical Skills (except Medicine)**        |
|   **Neutral Skills**   |      **Mental Skills (Except Nature), Bluff**       |
| **Unfavorable Skills** | **Social Skills (except Bluff), Medicine, Nature,** |
|                        |                                                     |

**Azag's Turn:** Having earned 3 Progress Successes from his intimidation gamble and getting another 2 Progress Successes from Gile’s quick thinking, things are looking up for Azag and his squire. The Player draws a Circumstance tarot and gets 8: Strength, this provides no Circumstance Boons or banes in this Circumstance. Now that the guards are locked up, there's only one thing left to do, bust out of here, literally. Azag makes a Brawn Skill Roll to break down any doors in their way. Azag rolls a 9, +5 Brawn Skill Modifier for a total of 14, more than enough to beat the DL 9 for Favorable Skills. In doing so he earns a Progress success and the _Inspiring Effort_ Progress Boon.

**Giles' Turn:** The Player draws a Circumstance Tarot Card and gets 13: Death getting the Circumstance Bane _Oops!_ Triggering a hidden Trap. Giles makes a Perception Defense Roll of 5 and adds his +5 Perception Defense Modifier for a value of 10 just short of defending against the Trap’s DL 11. Giles stumbles over a hard to see tripwire and triggers a Sound Alarm Trap. Giles and Azag become Deafened in the blaring alarm and more guards arrive. Things look bad but Giles knows they are almost out, they just need to press on. Giles can hardly concentrate with the loud noise but goes to pick the lock on the last door, using a lock pick he had stored in his _Magic Pocket_ ability. With a Penalty Die due to the loud noise, Giles rolls an Equipment Skill Roll against the last door, He rolls a 9 on his Primary Die and a 4 on his Secondary die and adds his +5 Equipment Skill Modifier as well as his +1 Bonus from the _Inspiring Effort_ Progress Boon Azag earned on his Turn, for a total of 11. Just enough to make it out. Despite the odds, Giles manages to get a Progress Success and the _Inspiring Effort_ Progress Boon. They have now earned all 9 necessary Progress Successes, so they have won the Adventure Encounter and escape.  However, they were not able to remove their 1 Progress Fail, which Azag caused, and therefore Azag gained 3 Stages of Exhaustion for his herculean effort breaking out of the prison. The pair now make their way to the palace to warn the king, but with Azag in such an exhausted state, will they make it in time?....

## CARRYING CAPACITY & ENCUMBRANCE

Carrying Capacity is a value that shows how much a Character can carry at any given time. A Character physically cannot exceed Carrying Capacity without dropping an object, a Creature who exceeds their Carrying Capacity has their speed set to 0 for as long as they are over encumbered. Carrying Capacity is measured in units of Encumbrance. ENCUMBRANCE is an abstract measurement that combines an object's weight and difficulty of carrying/storing. An object can have an encumbrance of 0-5, 5 being very heavy, or unwieldy, or both. For example, a Great sword might only weigh about 6 pounds which is not very heavy for an object in general, but its immense size makes it difficult to store and therefore it has a higher encumbrance value (3). A Character has a Carrying Capacity of 20 if they are a Size 1 Creature and 15 if they are a size ½ Creature. Carrying Capacity increases for a Creature by 10 for every Size above 1 it is. In addition, a Character can add Packs and Bags, and other such objects that will either increase their total Capacity or reduce the amount of Encumbrance an object has. A Creature that is being carried has 10 Encumbrance if they are a Size 1 Creature, for each Size up beyond 1 a Creature is its Encumbrance is increased by 10, such that a Size 2 Creature is 20 encumbrance or Size 3 Creature is 30 encumbrances to be carried. A Size ½ Creature weighs 5 Encumbrance to be Carried and a Size ¼ Creature is 1 Encumbrance to be carried. When carrying a Creature include their current Encumbrance on top of their Size’ Encumbrance to include their equipment and items.

## CIRCUMSTANCE TAROT

Adventures are wild and unstable things. Rarely does anything ever go as planned and a Weaver can use the Tarot for narrative devices to create an engaging scene. These Circumstance Tarot simulate chaotic, dangerous, and uncontrolled environmental hazards. They don't need to be used in regular combat or even against swarms (See Chapter 10: Combat Rules) unless something about their environment they are in could be a danger to them. For example, a bar fight in a tavern wouldn't pose any danger to the players since the tavern itself does not have any dangerous elements (outside of the patrons). However, the players fighting goblins in their cave would potentially be dangerous as the cave could be Trapped or filled with toxic mushrooms and gas and therefore would count as an environmental hazard. Alternatively, an external situation could be affecting the players directly or indirectly. for example, an earthquake might cause a delay on their journey or they only have a few minutes before a demonic ritual is complete. All of these are situations where it would be appropriate to use Circumstance Tarot. Circumstance Tarot are rolled into the Tarot draws used for Initiative and Turn Order. A Scenario may have a number of Tarot that when drawn as part of Initiative (and not as part of Trusting Fate) have an effect on that Creature that drew the card. If a scenario does not involve initiative, then each scene have the Players draw Tarot for Circumstance. An example of when to use Circumstance is: the Players find themselves having a only a few minutes before a demonic ritual is completed, the Count Down Circumstance would be the most appropriate of the Circumstances, so when the players & cultists draw for initiative, any Creature that pulls a card that matches one of the circumstance tarot for countdowns is affected by the effect listed on the circumstance tarot. A Weaver may consider using more than one Circumstance per scenario if multiple apply, however using too many will slow down the game, typically its best to use the most appropriate Circumstance, but where it feels appropriate, it is recommended to use no more than seven circumstances for any one scenario. 

Here are some scenarios and examples of Circumstances where Circumstance Tarot would be appropriate and fun.

### COUNT DOWN

There are only minutes before the bomb goes off, after taking the treasure the cave begins to collapse, our heroes tear up the road on a stolen getaway vehicle, we only need to hold out until reinforcements arrive, the growing shadows reach out to grab their victims into the darkness. These are all some examples of Count Down Circumstances. Count Downs are exciting and unique parts of adventures in which the Party has an additional challenge of a time pressure. Count Downs are measured in Rounds, like combat. The number of Rounds is typically based by time, to assign a number of Rounds for the Count Down, count each Round as 10 seconds. In some scenarios it where the scale is grander, the Weaver may also set each Round as 1 minute instead. For example, the Players may need to escape from a collapsing building and may only have 3 rounds (30 seconds) before the building falls on them. For the Purposes of Circumstance Boons and Banes, the word FACTION will be used to designate “sides” of a conflict. For example, the Player’s Party is a faction, and so are the Foes that oppose them. Should a third or even fourth group become involved you can Denote them as Factions for the purposes of determining the targets of Circumstance Boons and Banes. Certain events can help or hinder their efforts to escape such as finding enemies in the way, a blocked passage, or a passage that opens those leads to a short cut. Some examples are:



### ENVIRONMENTAL HAZARDS

Blistering winds tear at your faces, the blazing heat of the sun bakes you into your armor, the frozen tundra pains your lungs as you breathe in the frigid air, the noxious fumes disorient and sicken you; you feel yourself sinking in the viscous black tar. Environmental Hazards are Circumstances in which the environment resents dangers and can affect the goals of Creatures and Players alike. Not always harmful, Environmental Hazards can range from impeding movement, shifting terrains, and exposure risks. Environmental Hazards are unique to their individual terrains. It is important to note that these Circumstances are not the same as the Natural Disasters that you will read later on in this chapter, although those natural disasters could occur during a Circumstance. Some examples are:



### INFILTRATION, DUNGEONS, & LAIRS 

Stealing the artifact from under they dragon’s nose, assassinating the high king, delving into dark caverns, the dens of powerful monsters, and bewildering magical ruins are all examples of Infiltrations, Dungeons or LAIRS. Lairs are dungeons that a powerful Creature resides in, a Creature whose power can affect the world around them and most potently in their home or Lair. In Dungeons & Lairs scenarios draw Circumstance Tarot at each new scene, combat or otherwise. 



### MASS COMBAT

 Arrows fly, the roar and crash of thunderous siege weapons defend the air, the trumpets blow and flags wave; the storming march of feet and the clanging of steel. Mass combat covers scenarios in which armies gather to do battle. In Mass Combat a Weaver can use Swarms (Chapter 10: Combat Rules: Swarms) to represent the different troops of warring factions. Not always simply to the death, Mass Combat often has objectives such as capturing certain points or structures of advantage or removing enemy leaders and dangerous weapons. Using the Circumstance Tarot a Weaver can simulate the chaotic goings on of war and large scale battles. Some examples are:



### TRAVELING/ JOURNEYING

 Traveling or Journeying happens between destination and when setting Pace.  For example, The Party of the Player Characters are moving between towns or scouting a new area to find a hidden crypt. During a Traveling scenario re-draw Circumstance Tarot at every new Scene. Some example Circumstances are:



## CURSES

 Many dangers and hazards wait those who would venture into dark depths or deep lairs. Curses are amongst the most feared wards that protect chests, doors, sanctuaries, or other items of significance. Curses can be thought of as magical Traps, such that one must Trigger the Curse somehow, usually unknowingly, and then the Curse must be identified and then purified either by Ability or by performing the ritual of the Counter Curse. To Identify a Curse and its appropriate Counter Curse is a Lore Skill Roll with a DL equal to the Lethality/Remedial Tier of Power of the Curse, such that a LTH Tier 1 Curse is a DL 7 to Identify (see more in Chapter 8: Equipment, Gear, & Economy: Consumables: Remedial/lethality Tier for more information). To find a Curse is an Investigation Skill Roll and a Weaver may determine the DL of finding a particular Curse by drawing a Tarot on the Difficulty Table.

Curses unlike most other traps are almost always against a Resolve Defense Roll instead of the typical Perception Defense. When a Creature Triggers a Curse it makes a resolve Defense Roll against the Curses DL which can simply be the Curses’ LTH Tier (See Chapter 8: Equipment, Gear, & Economy: Consumables: Remedial & Lethality Tier for more information.) or its DL can be Determined by the Difficulty Table above, as the Weaver chooses. Like other Traps however, Curses do not gain a Bonus Die on their Attack Roll/Value for a Surprise attack.  Creatures that fail this Resolve Defense Roll are afflicted with the Curse, and those that pass are able to resist the Curse with no ill-effects. Curses do not deal Wounds to other Creatures like some other Traps do. 

Curses unlike most other traps are not simply over when the Trap Triggers. Curses often have lingering effects that are difficult to remove. To Remove a Curse one must apply the appropriate Counter Curse, which is some ritual used to break the Curse’s effects. See the table below labeled Counter Curses Table to randomly generate a Counter Curse for a particular Curse. Counter Curses often become smaller side quests within quests, or a fun way to spice up a particular encounter. Weavers should feel prepared to improvise for solutions, for example, a typical Counter Curse to say the name of the Curses’ creator out loud three times, the Weaver can now add the element of saying that perhaps the caster of the Curse is an adversary in the Dungeon they are currently in. This means Players will now have to be careful about who they kill or if they choose to kill at all for fear of losing the name forever.  Some of the details for the Curses of the world of Amarant are listed below

Conditions and Banes caused by having a Curse cannot be removed by conventional means or other Abilities that normally rid oneself of these effects. The only way  to remove Conditions and Banes granted by Curses is to remove the Curse with an appropriate Counter Curse or with a purifying effect such as a Potion of Purification or the _Purify_ Ability.

### **CURSES DETAILS**

**Gossipers Curse -** the Gossiper’s Curse is activated if a Creature or Player speaks a particular word within the Curses effective range, which is an area of 10 x 10 tiles per Tier of Power the Weaver would like to set the Gossiper’s Curse at a center point. Creatures that fail their Resolve Defense Roll against this Curse are unable to speak vocally. This Curse cannot be remedied unless it is removed by an Ability or by performing a randomly drawn Counter Curse that has an RMD equal to the Curse’s LTH. 

**Simpleton’s Curse -** The Simpleton’s Curse is Triggered if a Creature reads a cursed inscription of any kind. Creatures that fail their Resolve Defense Roll against this Curse lose the ability to read and write and can only speak in the first word of the Cursed Inscription. This Curse cannot be remedied unless it is removed by an Ability or by performing a randomly drawn Counter Curse that has an RMD equal to the Curse’s LTH. 

**Thieves’ Curse -** The Thieves’ Curse is Triggered by picking up a Cursed object. The affected Creature loses the ability to use its hands/appropriate appendages until the Curse is lifted. This means a Creature cannot use any weapons, equipment, tools, or use Skills that would require the use of that appendage. This Curse has a specific Counter Curse which is to have the Creature return the object back to the location of its taking, at which time the ability to move their hands will be restored. Creature may find this a difficult task without the use of their hands however. 

**Trespasser’s Curse -** The Trespasser’s Curse is Triggered by crossing a Cursed threshold. For a Weaver’s purposes a threshold can be any liminal space such as doorways, entrances, physical transitions, or walls and territory borders.  Creatures that fail their Resolve Defense Roll against this Curse are unable to pass any thresholds or liminal spaces, including the Cursed threshold. Any Abilities or attacks that the Cursed Creature tries to extend beyond any thresholds are prevented from doing so. However, the Cursed Creatures can still see, hear, speak, or sense things beyond their threshold, so long as the nature of the threshold would normally allow for it. For example, a beach Cursed with the Trespasser’s Curse may begin where the Sand starts to form, however a Cursed Creature can still see, hear, or speak to Creature’s beyond the sand line, but are unable to use Abilities or Attacks through it. However, a Creature trapped in a soundproof room that has the Trespasser's Curse would be unable to hear or speak to other Creatures due to the nature of the room, not the nature of the Curse. This Curse cannot be remedied unless it is removed by an Ability or by performing a randomly drawn Counter Curse that has an RMD equal to the Curse’s LTH. 

**Glutton’s Curse -** The Glutton’s Curse is Triggered by a Creature consuming a Cursed food or drink. Creatures that fail their Resolve Defense Roll against this Curse are forced to violently vomit at the sight or smell of any food or flavored drink. A Creature that vomits in this way gains one Level of Exhaustion. This Curse cannot be remedied unless it is removed by an Ability or by performing a randomly drawn Counter Curse that has an RMD equal to the Curse’s LTH. 

**Voyeur’s Curse -** The Voyeur’s Curse is Triggered by a Creature, seeing, hearing, or scrying magically or otherwise into a Cursed (often closed) room. Creatures that fail their Resolve Defense Roll against this Curse become Blind or Deaf (set at the Curses’ creation). This Curse cannot be remedied unless it is removed by an Ability or by performing a randomly drawn Counter Curse that has an RMD equal to the Curse’s LTH. 

**Gazer’s Curse -** The Gazer’s Curse is Triggered by a Creature(s) staring into a reflective surface and seeing their reflection. Creatures that fail their Resolve Defense Roll against this Curse become unable to take Actions or do anything else but stare at their reflection. The Creature gains the Paralyzed Condition. (See Chapter 9 : Adventuring Rules: Conditions). This Curse has a specific Counter Curse which is to physically move the staring Creature away from the reflective object and turn their gaze away from it, at which point they will promptly be free from the Curse, unless they gaze upon the Cursed Reflective surface again. Weavers will note that such a task is impossible for a lone Creature, and is quite difficult to remove a Cursed Creature without oneself becoming Cursed as well. 

**Tormentor’s Curse -** The Tormentor’s Curse is Triggered by Attacking a Creature who is holding the Curse (either by placing it upon themselves, or by having another do so for them), regardless of the Attack’s success. Creatures that fail their Resolve Defense Roll against this Curse share all of the physical and mental pain of the Creature holding the Curse. Anytime the Creature holding the Curse takes Damage or even if they feel distress, that distress and/or Damage is shared with the Cursed Creature. The Damage that is shared is always the exact same amount as the Creature who is holding the Curse’s damage subtracted by that same Creature’s Armor Value. Conditions are also shared between the Creatures. One Creature triggering this Curse does not prevent other Creatures from also triggering the Curse, however the same Creature cannot be Cursed twice in the same day by the same instance of the Curse. For example, Azog the Dire Orc attacks a Creature that is holding the Curse, Azag rolls his Perception Defense Roll against the Curse but fails, becoming afflicted with the Tormentor’s Curse. Now anytime Azag tries to harm that Creature Azag and deals 7 points of Slashing Damage, subtracted against the Creature holding the Curses’ 3 Armor Value for a total of 4 Slashing Damage. Azag will also take 7 points for Slashing Damage after subtracting the Creature holding the Curse’s Armor Value, thus Azag takes 4 Damage, regardless fo Azag’s Armor Value. If Azag were to find and perform the Counter Curse he would be free of the Curse and able freely harm the Creature holding the Curse without fear of being afflicted again for 24 hours. This Curse cannot be remedied unless it is removed by an Ability or by performing a randomly drawn Counter Curse that has an RMD equal to the Curse’s LTH. 

**Murderer’s Curse -** The Murderer’s Curse is Triggered by killing a Creature who is holding the Curse (either by placing it upon themselves, or by having another do so for them). This Curse has no mechanical penalty, but the afflicted constantly has blood dripping from them. Most sentient Creatures in Amarant are aware of this Curse and realize that this means the Creature is a murderer. Weaver’s are encouraged to play into the social stigma that one might have should someone see a Creature or a player with such a Curse. This Curse has a specific Counter Curse which is for the Cursed Creature to admit their guilt in killing the Cursed Creature to another Creature that the Cursed Creature perceives as an authority figure. The Cursed Creature does not need to specify the means nor the reason for the murder for the Curse to be broken, however The Cursed Creature has to be able to specifically identify whom they have killed, either by name or by being able to point out the body in some way. 

**Reneger’s Curse:** The Reneger’s Curse is triggered by going back on a promise or betraying an alliance. The Creature that is Cursed receives Reneger’s Guilt. Reneger’s Guilt physically burdens the Cursed Creature. Upon first receiving the Reneger’s Guilt, and every 24 hours afterwards, the guilt adds the Curse’s LTH Tier in Encumbrance to the Creature’s Carrying Capacity. Reneger’s Guilt is cumulative and stacks with itself. The Counter Curse to the Reneger’s Curse is to either fulfill the promise, or by making other reparations that grant the approval of the creature to whom the promise was broken.

**Coward’s Curse:** The Coward’s Curse causes the Cursed Creature to be permanently Frightened of an object or other Creature/ Creature Type until the Curse is lifted. This Curse ignores any immunities to Fear or the Frightened Condition the Cursed creature possesses. This Curse can also be placed on an object, Cursing anyone within 10 Tiles per LTH Tier of the Curse with the Coward’s Curse. This Curse cannot be remedied unless it is removed by an Ability or by performing a randomly drawn Counter Curse that has an RMD equal to the Curse’s LTH. 

## DISEASES

### **Diseases Overview**

The diseases, illness, and the pestilence that Plague Amaranth no simple matter. In a world of both magic and science, Amarant’s Diseases take on many forms and are severely debilitating and often fatal. Disease can be found almost everywhere and can be difficult to recover from. In Amarant, Diseases are quickly spreading and active requiring no incubation periods and start affecting creatures immediately upon catching the illness. Diseases are long lasting, remaining until they are cured or the Creature dies. Diseases also spread quickly to other Creatures through INFECTION ROLLS (See below in Catching Diseases).

**Catching Diseases**

Diseases can be caught in a variety of places and from a variety of creatures. Most Diseases in Amarant are air-borne but there are a few that can be caught with direct contact from creatures. When a Character comes to contact with a Disease (Direct or Indirect) they need to make a Defense Roll (Typically Fortitude, although some Diseases may target another Defense) if the Defense Roll is successful then the Character does not become afflicted with the Disease. This is known as an **Infection Roll.** Infection Rolls are made upon initially coming into contact with a Disease and again every 24 hours after being afflicted with a Disease until the Disease is cured. On the initial Infection Roll against a Disease, a successful roll prevents the character from being afflicted with the Disease. On a Successful Infection Roll made after being afflicted with the Disease (every 24 hours after being afflicted) the character does not gain any Stages of Exhaustion and can ignore the Symptoms of the Disease until the next Infection Roll for that Disease. On a failed Infection Roll (Initially or after 24 hours) the character becomes afflicted with the disease, immediately suffers one Stage of Exhaustion per Lethality Tier of the Disease and suffers its Symptoms. Additionally on a failed Infection Roll, any creatures within 6 Tiles of the Creature must also make Infection Rolls or be afflicted with the Disease themselves. Characters can only be afflicted with one instance of a specific Disease, with the Disease with the highest Lethality Tier overriding the existing Disease.

For example, a Azag is currently affiliated with the Common Chill at the third Tier of Lethality and so cannot be afflicted by another instance of the Common Chill that is Lethality Tier three or lower, but can be afflicted with the Common Chill at fourth Lethality Tier. This would make Azag suffer -4 Penalty to all Rolls rather than -3 and he would gain one additional Stage of Exhaustion for the difference between 4th and 3rd Lethality Tiers of the Disease. It is also possible for Characters to be afflicted with multiple Diseases at once. The severity of the Stages of Exhaustion gained and the Symptoms of the Disease are determined by the Lethality Tier of the Disease (See Difficulty Tier Table

**Side Note:24 Hours**

Infection Rolls are intended to be done immediately after becoming afflicted with a Dies and every 24 hours from that point, however, if time is being tracked loosely, consider making Infection Roll at the dawn of each day or when the Character first wakes up from a long rest to make it easy to remember and more convenient to track.

**Curing a Disease**

Diseases can be cured in one of three ways, by Medicine Skill Rolls, Potions of Cure Disease, and the various Abilities such as _Cleanse Body._ To Cure a Disease with a Medicine Skill Roll, the Disease must first be identified using a Medicine Skill Roll against the appropriate DL for Diseases Lethality (See Difficulty Tier Table). Once the identification is complete, another Medicine Skill Roll can be made to cure the Disease at the same DL. The Medicine Skill Roll to cure the Disease takes 1 hour to complete, when the Disease is cured all symptoms stop but any Exhaustion gained from the Disease remains. 

Potions and Abilities of the same or greater Remedial Tier of the Disease’s Lethality Tier immediately cure the Disease, without needing to identify the Disease first, ending any effects from the Symptoms but not any Exhaustion gained from the Disease. Consuming a Potion of a lower Remedial Tier than the Disease’s Lethality Tier grants a Bonus to the next Medicine Skill Roll made by you or another creature to Cure your Disease equal to the Remedial Tier of the Potion. For example, Azag has caught the Common Chill at Lethality Tier 3, if he consumes a Potion of Cure Disease with Remedial Tier 2, it will not be able to cure him but it does give him or Giles (whoever performs the Medicine Skill Roll) a +2 Bonus (from Remedial tier 2) to their Medicine Skill Roll to Cure the Disease.

Abilities such as _Cleanse Body_ work the same way that Potions of Cure Disease do if the Tier of Power of the Ability is less than the Lethality Tier of the Disease.

### POISONS

Poisons or mundane poisons are toxic chemicals or substances that harm an individual. Examples range from the less deadly such as alcohol to deadly poisons like Arsenic or venom from dangerous wildlife. Identifying a Poison is done with a Nature or Medicine Skill Roll as appropriate and can be treated with the same type of roll.

## EARSHOT

 Earshot is the term used to describe how far away a Creature may be able to accurately hear another Creature who is speaking. This range is 6 Tiles or 30 ft.

When a Creature is Yelling, they can be heard from twice the regular value a range of 12 tiles or 60ft.

When a Creature is Whispering, they can only be heard from 1 tile or 5ft away.

## EXHAUSTION & RESTING

Exhaustion is a numerical representation of a Character’s fatigue. A Character exhausts itself in many ways, such as being subject to harsh weather effects, lack of sleep, lack of food or water, being diseased, physically or mentally stressing yourself for extended periods of time, etc… Below is a chart showing the Stages of Exhaustion. It is important to note that Exhaustion comes in Stages, each time you would gain a Stage of Exhaustion, you move on to the next Stage of Exhaustion. Each Stage of Exhaustion is cumulative and to resist gaining a Stage of Exhaustion a Creature must make a Fortitude Defense Roll vs DL 7. For each time a Creature would consecutively attempt to resist gaining a Stage of Exhaustion the DL increases by 2. For example, Azag the Dire Orc did not sleep last night, meaning he must beat a Fortitude Defense Roll of DL 7 or gain the 1st Stage of Exhaustion, which would give him a -1 to Attack, Defense and Skill Rolls. He then chooses to run a great distance in the same day making the Fortitude Defense Roll vs DL value a 9, if he were to fail this attempt, he would gain a Stages of Exhaustion or go to the next Stages of Exhaustion if he failed his first Fortitude Defense Roll against Exhaustion. A Weaver can choose to give out more than one Stages of Exhaustion, however, the task being performed would have to be truly strenuous and punishing. 

At the 1st Stages of Exhaustion, you get -1 to Attack, Defense, Skill Rolls, and Speed

At the 2nd Stages of Exhaustion, you get -2 to Attack, Defense, Skill Rolls, and Speed

At the 3d Stages of Exhaustion, you get -3 to Attack, Defense, Skill Rolls, and Speed

At the 4th Stages of Exhaustion, you get -4 to Attack, Defense, Skill Rolls, and Speed

At the 5th Tier you go unconscious and must trust Fate to stabilize or die.

You can overcome exhaustion through resting. There are 2 kinds of resting, Short and Long Rests. A Character can perform any of these at any time, however, a Character should be wise to choose a time when they are not in danger. It would be a quick end to a Character to make camp in the middle of a warzone or Dungeon. 

You can follow the Exhaustion rules when dealing with drugs, alcohol and other similar substances. Each time you ingest the substance make an appropriate Fortitude Defense Roll against the substance (treated like a poison with various DL to ingest based on lethality tiers). On a failure you take a level of exhaustion that represents intoxication. At the fifth tier you fall unconscious and must Trust Fate to stabilize. If you ingest more of the substance while unconscious or take so much that you would get two levels of exhaustion, you die of an overdose unless you succeed on your Fortitude Defense roll.

### RESTING

Resting is just as important for adventurers as the combat is! To be fully rested a Player or creature must take a full 8 hours of sleep. Resting for a Full 8 hours will remove 1 Stage of Exhaustion. Failing to get this necessary 8 hours will result in a Stage of Exhaustion. 

##  FALLING DAMAGE

 Falling happens often to adventurers who find themselves unprepared. Falling from a certain height can have deadly consequences. However, with each fall you can attempt an Acrobatics Skill Roll against the Difficulty Tier Table DL to land safely and minimize your damage. If you fail to meet the DL with your Acrobatics Skill Roll then you suffer the effect of falling from the height and the effects of falling from smaller heights. If you succeed your Acrobatics Skill Roll, you suffer none of the effects. For example, Azag the Dire Orc falls 20ft, he must make an Acrobatics Skill Roll to beat the DL 9. He rolls a 1 plus his Acrobatics of +0 giving him a total of 1. He failed and therefore breaks his leg and takes 2 True Bludgeoning Damage (from falling 20ft), and he must take the Penalty as if he had fallen 10ft as well, which is landing Prone. For every 10ft passed the 50ft mark, the DL goes up by 2, and the effect is always instant death.

10ft = 1 True Dmg and land prone, DL = 7 (From Difficulty Tier Table)

20ft = 2 True Dmg and prone and broken feet/ankles. Creatures with a Broken Feet/ankles are Restrained until a Successful Medicine Skill Roll is made against the DL equivalent to the DL of the fall (if greater than 20 ft), Dl = 9 (from Difficulty Tier Table)

30ft = 3 True Dmg and and Disable limb (leg) wound and until a Successful Medicine Skill Roll is made against the DL equivalent to the DL of the fall (if greater than 20 ft), Dl = 9 (from Difficulty Tier Table)

40ft = 4 True Dmg + Prone + Disabled Leg + Unconscious (trust fate to stabilize or die)

50ft = Instant death

## NON-STANDARD MOVEMENT

There are times when an adventurer will need to use one of the following types of non-standard movement, climbing, crawling, jumping, swimming, squeezing. When these occur, use the following rules

·        **Burrow:**  A Creature That has a Burrow Speed can quickly move underground through the earth. A Creature that has a Burrow Speed is not considered Open when they go underground to start this movement, nor when they surface. Burrowing Creatures cannot see their environment while burrowed but can remember the positioning’s of other Creatures at the time of them burrowing. Creatures with a Burrow Speed cannot burrow through solid stone, metal, or wood., unless specifically stated otherwise.

·        **Climbing:** A Creature can climb up to half their total Speed without a successful Athletics Skill Roll to climb. A Successful Athletics Skill Roll to climb means a Creature can Climb its full Speed. If a 1 is rolled on the die for an Athletics Skill Roll, the Creature falls off whatever it was climbing. While you are climbing, you can make attacks with one handed weapon and focus as normal. You cannot attack with a two-handed weapon unless you are able to wield it in one hand such as through the _Versatile Grip_ Ability. When climbing you cannot attack other Creature’s openings, but while climbing you are Open. Creatures with a Climb Speed can always climb their Climb Speed without having to roll an Athletics Skill Roll.

·        **Crawling:** when in a prone position, you can choose to crawl instead of standing up. You can crawl up to half your speed and are prone the whole time. You are Open when you crawl. You can attack with a weapon or foci while crawling, however you have a Penalty Die to do so.

·        **Flying:** Creatures with a Fly Speed can move through the air and move vertically at their Fly Speed. Creatures that have a Flight Speed do not begin to fall at the end of their movement. If a Creature with a Fly Speed or that is Mid-Air is Restrained, unconscious, Paralyzed, Stunned, or made Prone that Creature plummets to the ground taking Falling Damage. (Chapter 9: Adventuring Rules: Falling Damage). 

·        **Jumping:** a Creature can attempt a long jump or a high jump. In a long jump, the Creature moves as many feet as the total value of their Athletics (or Acrobatics) Skill Roll. In a high jump, the Creature attempts to jump vertically, and can jump up as many feet as their total Athletics Skill Roll divided by 2(Rounded Down). 

·        **Swimming:** A Creature can swim up to half their total speed without an Athletics Skill Roll. With a successful Athletics Skill Roll a Creature can swim its full Speed value. On a roll of a 1 of an Athletics Skill Roll to swim, the Creature starts to Suffocate. You may also need to hold your breath (see Chapter 9: Adventuring Rules: Suffocation & Drowning Rules).  While you are swimming, you can make attacks with weapons and focus at a Penalty Die unless you have a Swim Speed. When swimming you cannot attack other Creature’s openings, but while swimming you are Open to Creatures who are not swimming or to Creatures that have a Swim Speed. If you are able to move your full speed while swimming (such as from the _Amphibian_ or _Aquatic_ or other similar abilities) you are able to attack Creature’s openings underwater or while swimming. Creatures with a Swim Speed can always swim their Swim Speed without having to roll an Athletics Skill Roll.

·        **Squeezing:** A Creature can Squeeze through any space that is 1 Size smaller than their Size. This space is considered a CONFINED SPACE (see more Chapter 10: Combat Rules: Confined Spaces) While Squeezing, you move at half your total Speed and are Open while squeezing. Unless your weapon has the Short Property, you cannot attack or attack another Creature’s Openings while you are Squeezing.

### **Athletics (Or otherwise appropriate Skill) Skill Roll Difficulty Level**
| **SPEED TYPE** | **DL 7**       | **DL 9**                                    | **DL 11**                                                               | **DL 13**                     | **DL 15**            |
| -------------- | -------------- | ------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------- | -------------------- |
| **Climbing**   | Simple Hill    | Requires technical climbing skills to climb | Requires advanced climbing techniques, hard to breathe or high altitude | Climb a near vertical surface | Climb a Flat surface |
| **Swimming**   | Standard River | Rapids or Rushing River                     | Rough Ocean Waves                                                       | Ocean during a storm          | Whirlpool or Vortex  |
|                |                |                                             |                                                                         |                               |                      |

Contrary to the general rules, If a Creature or Players is doing Non-Standard Movement, they cannot pass through allies like they could normally. However, a Creature or Player that has a Non-Standard Movement Speed, such as a Flight Speed or Swim Speed, may pass through allies using the Non-Standard Movement Type is possesses.

## **Objects and Hit Threshold**

There may be times when the Players come across an object that needs to be damaged or destroyed, such as breaking down a door or breaking a cursed mirror. All objects have a HIT THRESHOLD (HT), that is, a number of HITS they can take before they are broken. An Object’s Hit Threshold is determined by the following formula: Encumbrance + Quality +1. Keep in mind that Encumbrance for any object that can be handheld or lifted is typically 1-5, however there are many objects, such as brick walls, that will have more than 5 Encumbrance. A good guideline to follow is that the object has 1 Hit Threshold per cubic foot it occupies. For example, a brick wall that is 10 ft high, 1 foot wide, and 1 foot thick would have roughly 10 Encumbrance. The quality of the object refers to how well it's made as well as its worth. Quality has the following ranges: Poor quality (-1 HT), Standard (no change in HT), Fine (+1 HT), Exceptional (+2 HT), Superior (+3 HT), Masterful (+4 HT), Grand Masterful (+5 HT). Using the previous example, a Poor quality Brick wall would have a total of 10 Hit Threshold (10 Encumbrance - 1 poor quality +1 =10) where a Superior Brick Wall would have 14 Hit Threshold (10 Encumbrance + 3 Superior Quality +1). 

There are some objects that may seem easier or harder to break than normal, for example glass is exceptionally easy to break while adamant is exceptionally hard to break. In Scenarios like this, the Weaver can choose to halve or double the total Hit Threshold an object has. Using the previous example of the 10x1x1 foot brick wall. If that was instead a tall mirror of the same dimensions, the Weaver could choose to halve the total Hit Threshold it would normally have as it is made mostly of glass, whereas if the wall was made of solid adamant the Weaver could double the Hit Threshold. The Weaver should use their best judgment when doing this however, using this only in cases were the material at hand is extremely weak (like glass or paper) or extremely strong (such as adamant), for most other materials (stone, wood, steel) it is usually best to not double or halve the Hit Threshold Values. 

**Damaging Objects**

There are two ways that an object can be damaged, either by the Character’s bare hands (Base Attacks) or with Weapons. To damage an object with the Character's bare hands, they need to make a Brawn Skill Roll, dealing Hits equal to the Brawn Skill Roll Value divided by 3 (Rounded Down). Larger creatures or Characters deal 1 additional Hit to an object’s Hit Threshold when they are breaking an object with their hands. For Example, a Size 3 creature deals 3 Hits to an object's Hit Threshold rather than 1.

When damaging an object with a Weapon, one needs to simply reduce the object’s Hit Threshold by the number of Hits the Weapon has. No Attack Rolls are necessary to Attack an object, however it still takes a Major Action to do so. Creatures larger than Size 1 damaging an object with Weapons deal additional Hits equal to their size. (see more in Chapter 9: Adventuring Rules: Size & Reach)

The Weaver may deem it appropriate for a particular material or object to be more Resistant or Vulnerable to certain Damage Types. For example, Bludgeoning Damage from a hammer will not do much damage to a carpet but Fire Damage will quickly burn it. In these cases the Weaver can increase or decrease the number of Hits a Weapon or Focus does by 1, based on the Damage Type being dealt and the material of the object.

## **PACE**

When Players set out to travel across vast distances, they set a PACE to do so. A Pace determines how quickly the Party tries to arrive at their destination and also how much wear and tear on their bodies that occurs during that journey. The Players may need to set a Pace multiple times in order to arrive at their destination, each Pace should be considered its one scene and have Circumstance Tarot applied as well. When Players set a Pace, they can choose from 6 Speeds which corresponds to the Difficulty Tier Table (a quick chart referencing the relevant part of the Difficulty Tier Table is shown below). Each Pace takes 1 Hour to complete, regardless of the speed of the Pace. If Players are setting a Pace individually, they use their own Speed Statistic to determine how many miles are traveled but if they travel as a group, they use the Speed Statistic of the member with the lowest Speed Value. For example, in a group of four players where the Speed Value are 10,8,6,4, when traveling as a group, the Player would set a Pace and calculate the number of Miles traveled using 4 Speed as its the lowest. When a Set of Pace is complete, each player and creature that participated in the Pace must make a Fortitude Defense Roll against the related Difficulty Tier or gain a Number of Stages of Exhaustion based on the Difficulty Tier. This Fortitude Defense Roll after Pace is called a **Fatigue Roll.** After each Pace, Players can choose a new Pace if they have not arrived at their destination yet, choosing to go slower if they are worried about getting more Exhausted or choosing to go faster if they feel they can manage the Exhaustion.

### DIFFICULTY TIER TABLE FOR PACE
| **Difficulty Tier**                 | **MILES traveled in 1 Hour** | **DL** | **Stages of exhaustion gained on a fail** |
| ----------------------------------- | ---------------------------- | ------ | ----------------------------------------- |
| **Extremely Easy (very slow)**      | **1/2 Speed in Miles**       | **5**  | **0**                                     |
| **Easy (slow)**                     | **Speed in Miles**           | **7**  | **1**                                     |
| **Average (average)**               | **Speed x2 in Miles**        | **9**  | **2**                                     |
| **Moderate (Moderate)**             | **Speed x3 in Miles**        | **11** | **3**                                     |
| **Difficult (fast)**                | **Speed x4 in Miles**        | **13** | **4**                                     |
| **Extremely Difficult (Very Fast)** | **Speed x5 in Miles**        | **15** | **5**                                     |

**Mounts & Vehicles with Pace**                                                                         

Players that are wealthy or lucky enough to have either Mounts or Vehicles can make their traveling significantly easier. When Players have a Mount or a Vehicle, they can use the Mount’s or Vehicle’s Speed when determining how many miles are traveled rather than their own speed and the characters get a Bonus Die to their Fortitude Defense Rolls made for Fatigue Rolls. If a Fatigue Roll is failed while using a Mount, both the Character and the Mount gain the appropriate Stages of Exhaustion from the Difficulty Tier of the Pace. Vehicles are unable to get Exhaustion but instead take 1 Hit Threshold Damage per Difficulty Tier as listed on the Difficulty Tier Table. 

**Critical Success/Fail during Pace**                                                                             

During Pace, if a Player Critically Succeeds (Roll of a 10) on their Fatigue Roll, they get to move additional miles equal to their Speed. On a Critical Failure on their Fatigue Roll, the Characters fall short of their Set of Pace by their Speed in Miles. For example, Azag has a speed for 4, at a Moderate Pace, Azag travels his Speed (4) x3 in miles for a total of 12 miles if he is successful. On a Critical Success with his Fatigue Roll, he moves an additional 4 miles (his Speed in Miles) for a total of 16 Miles. On a Critical Fail, he falls short of his 12 mile goal by 4 miles (his Speed in Miles for a total of 8 miles traveled. It is possible to get multiple Critical Successes and Failures during one instance of Pace, in cases like, add (or subtract) each of the miles added or subtracted from the total. Using the earlier example, if two Players rolled a Critical Success and one player rolled a Critical Fail, the characters would be moved an additional 8 miles (4 miles twice for two Critical Successes) and subtract 4 miles (for Critical Fail) for a total of 4 additional miles moved. At a Very Easy Pace, Characters only move ½ their Speed in miles so when the Fatigue Roll is a Critical Fail the Characters instead make no progress on their journey. 

**Exploration during Pace**                                                                     

During a Character's travels they will have time to interact with the world around them. They may see grand sights or wish to use this time to get to know their traveling companions. When a Pace is started, the Weaver can introduce more exploration options by telling the Players what their characters can see from three different distances; Faraway Distance, Approaching Distance, and Nearby Distance. Something that they can see that is Faraway requires 2 sets of Pace to reach it, where something that is Approaching is something that is only 1 set of Pace away, and something Nearby is something you can reach during your current Pace. Giving these three options to the characters to explore not only adds depth to the setting, but will give Players choices that make traveling more exciting. Upon seeing what is in the distance, players may choose to abandon their course or come back to a certain spot later. Typically, the Weaver should have a general idea of what could be in the distance for characters to see, however often improvisation will be required, the following is a list of ideas to help the Weaver plan ahead or improvise exploration during Pace.  

**Exploration Table -** *thinking some of these should actually be more vague. Some are too specific to be used everywhere. 

### EXPLORATION TABLE

**Change of Timing during Pace**                                                                                 

Its possible that during a Character’s travel they can run into Combat Encounters, Adventure Encounters or people/places of interest while exploring. When Encounters or events like these happen they may affect the amount of time it takes to complete the Pace. The Weaver should use their best judgment to determine how much impact an Encounter or event has on the Pace, for example a Combat Encounter that lasts 3 Rounds is typically only 30 seconds of fighting, and therefore won’t greatly impact the pace, however if the players take time to explore a ruined tower, that could take long enough to affect the pace, so that it take 2 hours to complete rather than 1. 

#### **Example of Play**                                                                                                        

Azag and his trusty squire Giles have learned that an ancient treasure lies beneath the town of Goldberg, but they are not the only ones who know about the secret treasure. Determined to get to it first, Azag and Giles plan to make a trip to Goldsberg; however,  the town is 20 miles away and a storm is rolling in. 

#### **Round 1:** 

Azag and Giles have decided to travel together so they will use Azag’s Speed of 4 (due to Azag’s Harū Magšaru, an ax with the Massive Property) rather than Giles Speed of 6. Unfortunately they lost their horses when they were last chased out of town so they will need to walk to Goldsberg. With the storm rolling in, they quickly deliberate how they will reach the next town. 

·        An Easy Pace will get them 4 miles in 1 hour, meaning it will take 5 hours (or 5 sets of an Easy Pace) to get there. Since the storm is coming they don't want to be exposed to the elements for long, and they don't want their rivals to reach the treasure first so they consider going as fast as they can. 

·        At an Extremely Difficult Pace, they would move Azag’s Speed times 5 for a total of 20 miles in 1 hour (4 Speed x 5). However, they are unsure that they could maintain that Pace as that is a tremendous effort and don't want to be too tired if they need to fight for the treasure. 

·        Another option they consider is a Moderate Pace, which will let them move at 3 times Azag’s speed (12 Miles) in an hour and therefore are able to do the trip in 2 hours.  

**Azag’s Turn:** They decide that the Moderate Pace makes sense and begin their journey. The Weaver declares that the Circumstance is Environmental: Storm, so Azag’s Player draws a Tarot Card, getting 7 The Chariot. With this he receives the Circumstance Bane Hurricane Winds and his speed is halved. This means that they will only travel 2 miles in their Pace rather than 4. 

**Giles Turn:** Giles’ Player draws from the Circumstance Tarot and draws 8 Strength. In this Circumstance this card provides no Boon or Bane. 

**Weaver:** The Weaver lets Azag and Giles know that even with the storm blowing in, they can see a mage’s tower at a Faraway Distance, a remote temple at an Approaching Distance and a cave at a Nearby Distance. Azag is excited to see the cave as its close by and figure they can wait out the storm in the cave, however Giles gently reminds Azag of the treasure and that the cave is likely occupied and unless he wants to fight for his shelter they might be better off going to the remote church ahead for a quick pit stop. Azag reluctantly agrees. They now make their Fatigue Rolls, They need to beat a DL of 11 for a Moderate Pace. Azag rolls a 2 and adds his Fortitude Defense of 5 for a total of 7, which is not enough to beat a 9. Azag gains 3 Stages of Exhaustion. Giles however rolls a 9, and adds his Fortitude Defense of 2 for a total of 11, which is enough to beat the Moderate Pace’s DL and therefore gains no Exhaustion. 

#### **Round 2:**

Azag and Giles have traveled 6 (Speed of 2 times 3 for Moderate Pace) of the 20 miles needed to reach their destination in the first hour, and Azag has already received 3 Stages of Exhaustion, it's not looking like a good start, but they are hoping to find shelter from the storm in the remote church. 

**Azag’s Turn:** Azag’s Player draw the Circumstance Tarot and gets 3 The Emperor, which is the Circumstance Bane Lightning Strike. Azag’s is struck by a rogue bolt of lightning and takes 15 Lightning Damage, which he reduces by his Armor Value of 6 for a total of 9 points of Damage. This is devastating and would have killed a lesser hero, “This treasure better be worth it!” Azag screams in pain. Unless he is healed, he is sure that he wouldn't survive another lightning strike and knows he needs to get out of the storm. 

**Giles Turn:** Giles player draws a Circumstance Tarot and gets 11 Justice, which in this Circumstance has no Boons or Banes. Giles uses his basic healing action to heal Azag for an additional 9 Radiant Damage, of which Azag’s Armor Value subtracts 6 for a total of 3 healing. Azag is now at 7 Hit Points and is feeling better. They now arrive at the remote church, where the local clergy recognize Azag as a hero that saved them from bandits years ago. They give them shelter from the storm and offer to have them stay the night but they do not have time. However, Azag and Giles are in luck, as the church offers two of their horses to the heroes. These Draft Horses have a Speed of 10 and will give the pair a Bonus Die to their Fatigue Rolls. During the hour it takes to arrive at the remote church, Giles is able to completely heal Azag from the Lightning Strike. 

**Weaver:** The Weaver informs the Players that  the Mages Tower is now approaching, but from where Azag and Giles are now they can see Goldsberg (walled town) at a Faraway Distance and a strange obelisk at a Nearby Distance. Azag and Giles decide to waste no time and race towards Goldsberg. Goldsberg is currently 14 miles away, the pair decide that they can actually take it easier now and do an Average Pace, as that will give them 20 Miles in 1 hour (Draft Horse Speed is 10, multiple by 2 for Average pace). They ride off each making their Fatigue Rolls; Azag rolls a 4 and adds his 5 Fortitude Defense but subtracts 3 from his 3 Stage of exhaustion for a total of 6. Because this is an Average Pace, this is not enough as he needs 9 total, luckily his mount gives him a Bonus Die to the roll, the Bonus Die yields 7 for a total of 13 which beats the DL of 9 so no additional Exhaustions is gained for Azag. Giles rolls a 1, a Critical Failure for his Fatigue Roll, the automatically fails his Fatigue Roll gaining 2 Stages of Exhaustion (for an Average Pace) and  in addition the pace is reduced by his Mount’s Speed in miles. Because Giles is riding a draft horse with a Speed of 10, the Pace is reduced by 10 miles. 

#### **Round 3:** 

It's been 2 hours since they first left for Goldsberg, Azag has 3 Stages of Exhaustion and Giles has 2 stages from the intensity of the Pace and Azag has been struck by lightning, which has been healed. They are 16 miles into their 20 mile journey, gaining the first 2 miles in the first hour after being delayed by the hurricane level winds and traveling 10 miles in the second hour, even though they had planned for 20 miles, Giles’ frail constitution was unable to keep that Pace. '

**Azag’s Turn:** Azag’s Player draws a Circumstance Tarot and gets 2 The High Priestess. This Card has no Circusmtance Boons or Banes for this Circumstance. Azag is worried about time, they had originally only planned to take 2 hours to get to Goldsberg but now it's going to take more time. But he is also heavily Exhausted and injured, he doesn't know if he should push his luck. Looking to his weary but faithful squire, Azag thinks it’s best that they ignore the obelisk and take an Easy Pace, it will take an hour but it will still get them the remaining 8 miles they need on their Draft Horse's Speed of 10. Giles agrees and they continue their dangerous journey. 

**Giles Turn:** Giles’ Player draws from the circumstance Tarot and gets 14 Temperance, which in this Circusmstance gives no Boons or Banes. 

**Weaver’s Turn:** The Weaver informs the players that the Tower is now Nearby, with Goldberg Approaching. Nothing of note is currently nearby. Since they are heading straight to Goldberg, they ignore the tower and roll their Fatigue Rolls. The DL is only 7 for an Easy Pace.  Azag rolls an 8, plus his Fortitude Defense of 5, subtracting 3 from his 3 Stages of Exhaustion for a total of 10, which is enough to beat the DL and not gain any further levels of Exhaustion. Giles rolls a 10, a Critical Success! Giles automatically succeeds his Fatigue Roll and they get to move an additional 10 Miles. Azag and Giles only needed 4 miles to get to Goldsberg in 1 hour, but have instead moved 20 miles. Since this is five times faster than they needed to go, the Weaver uses their judgment and rules that the remaining portion of the trip only took 12 minutes (⅕ of the hour). In total their trip to Goldsberg took 2 hours and 12 minutes, hopefully fast enough to reach the treasure first. In their Exhausted state, Azag and Giles begin their search.   
  

## RANDOM DIRECTIONS

 There will be times where a Weaver may need to determine a random direction. Such instances can be determining which direction a blinded Creature moves in, which direction a swirling vortex might spit out a Creature and so on. To determine a random direction, Roll a ten-sided die to determine the direction of travel. A roll of 1-8 determines directions in a clockwise fashion (1 being forward, or where the Creature is currently facing, 3 to the right, 5 backwards, 7 left, the even numbers being diagonal between the odd number directions), a roll of 9 is down or a Creature seek slower ground, or if it can do neither of the two, it can lay prone to get as low as possible; a roll of 10 is upwards into the air, or compels the Creature to seek higher ground, by climbing, flying, or looking for any surface with higher elevation that it is currently at.  If a Creature cannot move any more down or up simply re-roll the die on a 9 or a 10.

## SIZE & REACH

Size Values determine how much space a Creature takes up on the board as well as other advantages and disadvantages. Sizes range from Size 0 to Size 5. Size 0 being Creatures like vermin, insects and anything smaller than a house cat. Size ¼ is the size for house cats, small dogs, and similarly sized animals. Size 1/2 is for Creatures like large dogs, Dwarves, the Seelie; although Size 0, ¼,  and 1/2 still fit into 1 Tile. Size 1 Creatures fit on 1 Tile, such as the playable races. Size 2 Creatures are larger Creatures like bears, tigers, and ogres. They fit on 2x2 Tiles taking up four total squares. Size 3 are monstrous in size such as Raventhars, Giant Animals, and young dragons and elementals, these Creatures occupy a 3x3 Tiles radius. Size 4 Creatures are truly massive and occupy a 4x4 Tiles area. The largest size is size 5, which only truly primordial and ancient beings can attain and are 5x5 Tiles in area. Creatures of this size are typically deified and have access to the universe's most powerful Abilities. Examples would be the eldest of Dragons and Elementals. A Creature’s Size also determines its REACH. Reach is the extent to which a Creature can grab or interact with objects or Creatures with its body. Besides humanoid entities, which often have a natural TOUCH REACH/RANGE of range 0 without weapons; most Creatures have a Reach equivalent to 0 to their Size. For example, a Size 1 Creature has a Touch Range of 0-1, a Size a Size 3 Dragon has a Reach of 0-3 Tiles where 0 range is the center of their token to the edge of the space it occupies, and the 3, of the 0-3 being 3 Tiles from the Edge of its Token. Similarly, a Size 5 Dragon would have a Reach of 0-5 Tiles where 0 range is the center of their token to the edge of the space it occupies the edge of the space it occupies, and being able to reach out 5 Tiles from the edge of its token outward.

### SIZE BONUSES & PENALTIES

Being of a larger Size can come with great strength but it can also comes with some drawbacks. Below you will find a list of the Bonuses and Penalties of Sizes.  

##### BONUSES

·        For each Size above 1, the Creature gets +5 Total Hit Points

·        For each Size above 1, the Creature gets +5 Total Carrying Capacity. Creatures at Size ½ have -5 Carrying Capacity and Creatures below Size ½ have -10 Carrying Capacity.
  

·        For each Size above 1, the Creature’s Maximum Range for their Base Attacks, Unarmed/Touch, and Weapon and Focus’ Reaches are increased by 1.

·        For each Size above 1, the Creature gains +1 Damage and +1 Hit to object’s Hit Threshold on all of its Successful Attacks and Abilities (Hit Threshold Damage only applies to Attacks and Abilities that deal Hits to Object’s hit Threshold)

·        For each Size above 1, the Creature can Cleave 1 additional Creature in its Attacks and Abilities

##### PENALTIES

Mostly the Penalties of being Larger in Size are not necessarily numeric. For example, a Creature that becomes or is a Size larger than 1 would likely not fit inside the doors, homes, or hallways of Size 1 Creatures. Further, the space required for a Larger Sized Creature to Squeeze is much larger than that of a smaller one, and Any Creature wishing to benefit from Cover must find Cover at least as tall and as Wide as they are (as the Depth of the Cover is usually negligible).

 Remember that unless stated otherwise, a Creature who grows into a different Size through an Ability or effect, does not also have their Equipment grow with them.

·       While one cannot wear Armor that is not their Size Value. This does not mean it will not be a perfect fit however. The generally bigger in stature Draconian Platemail may fit loosely on a smaller framed Wild Elf, but because they are both a Size Value of 1, they can both wear the Armor without issue.

·       Although a Creature may use a Weapon or Focus that is not their Size Value, they Attack or Use Abilities at a Penalty Die. They do not deal any more or less Damage than the Creature would otherwise do with the Weapon however.

·       The Price of any Equipment is Multiplied by a Creature’s Size Value above 1, squared. Such that a Size 2 Great Sword has x4 the cost of a Size 1 Great sword and a Size 3 would be x9 the cost.

·       Using any Consumable Item, Such as Potions or Poisons requires a total dosage of the Creature’s Size above 1, squared. Such that a Size 2 Creature would need x4, Size 1 Potions of Healing to receive any Benefit, and a Size 3 Creature would need x9 Size 1 Potions. 

·       For each Size Value above 1, a Creature takes up its Size Value squared in Seats on a Vehicle.


### Sharing Space / Range 0

In Kismet, Allied Creatures can share space, that is have 2 or more Creatures in the same Tiles. Any one Tile can hold two individuals of Size 1/2 or greater in its space. This means that two humanoids can be within the same five square foot area, or even a Size 1 humanoid can be in 0 range of size 3, 4, or 5 Creatures, so long as no other Creatures also occupy that same Tile. Creatures that are not allies would consider this invasion of space aggressive and sharing space with a non-allied Creature is considered being within 0 Range of that Creature.

 While Creatures that are smaller than Size ½ exist, Weavers are encouraged to use their best judgement when determining how many can reasonable fit, this means have the ability to act and move without squeezing against each other, inside a Tile. 

## SUFFOCATION & DROWNING

A size 1 Creature can hold its breath up to 30 seconds, or 3 rounds. Double or half that amount (rounded down to the nearest 10 second interval) for each size larger or smaller than size 1 respectively.  After that time frame the Creature needs to make a Fortitude defense roll equal DL 5 to go another 10 seconds (1 round). Every round after the DL increases by 2 until the Creature fails, at which point the Creature gains the suffocation/drowning condition. During the drowning/suffocating state, you are unconscious and if not removed from the dangerous environment within 1 round of falling unconscious the Creature dies. A Creature that is removed from the environment is still in danger of dying (as it may have water or smoke in its lungs) but can be resuscitated with a DL 7 Medicine Skill Roll or similar related Skill. If you Critically Fail on your Fortitude Defense Roll instantly drown. Strangling uses similar rules, however, to strangle a Creature you must first successfully grapple them. Once grappled you can use a Major action to Strangle. Strangling does not deal HP damage, instead you make an Attack Roll or Brawn Skill Roll against the Creature’s Fortitude Defense Roll, if you succeed the Creature takes one level of Exhaustion. If you get a Critical Success with your strangulation Attack Roll (or roll a 10 on your Brawn Skill Roll to Strangle) the Creature instead takes two levels of Exhaustion. If you sneak up on someone and strangle them it counts as a Critical Success for the first round of Strangulation. 

## UNIQUE SENSES

Many Creatures have Unique Senses that allow them to perceive the world around them in many fascinating ways that the most mortals cannot.

**BLIND SENSE**

Blind Sense, usually stemming from a Psychic Sense or by any other means of acquiring it, is the ability to “see” without eyes. Creatures with Blind Sense can perceive Creatures and objects near by them in any directions, including behind, below, or above them, but cannot through those Creatures or objects. Blind Sense does not include the ability to see color however.

**TREMOR SENSE**

Similar to Blind Sense, Tremor Sense is the ability to detect vibrations at a fine level. Detect weight, outlines, and even strain on the Creatures and objects around the Tremor Sensing Creatures.  Tremor Sense unlike Vision provides a near perfect clarity of all the directions around the Creature, except for objects and Creature that are flying or are above the Creature with Tremor Sense (although a Creature using Tremor Sense can detect motion and objects below itself and below the ground). Tremor Sense is usually quite small in range compared to something like Sight, and it cannot see things like color.
