This is the first chapter in which it is discussed how to build a Character. It is recommended that you print out a copy of the Character sheet so that you can plug in any numbers, values, or notes as you go and have a full Character sheet by the end of reading the next couple of chapters. You do not have to use the official Character sheet; you can use digital copies or even scrap paper as long as you can record the information your Character needs. Once you have completed all of following chapters, you will want to create a backstory for your Character, incorporating all your personality aspects as well as class factions and racial heritage as well as any events that may have led you to begin adventuring. A backstory can be as long or as short as you want it to be, but you will want one that gives the Weaver enough information to hook your Character into story settings, but not so much information that the Weaver cannot keep track. Before creation there is a quick guide and checklist for the thought process behind our player “Jeff” who is making the Character Azag the Dire Orc. These exists solely as a way to help guide new players and should be referred back to. Continuing in the next sections of this book will provide all of the necessary information needed for Character creation starting with statistics, Skills, and followed by all the other necessary information to fully make your Character.

## TAROT

The Tarot are the representation of all the threads of fate that are attached to a Creature when it is born. All the planets, satellites, histories, memories, and physical aspects that went into the creation of the life of that Creature. These threads of fate determine if the Character has any BOONS or BANES in their fate for that day and can be used to TRUST FATE (see Below). Each Character has a set of 10 cards and a Character sheet consists of several SPACES a Major Arcana, Swords, Pentacles, Wands, and Chalices spaces. Each of the Spaces represent a different statistic effected by the Tarot each day. They are the Swords for Attack, Pentacles for Defense, Wands/Staves for Speed, Chalices for Skills, and Major Arcana for all four of those statistics in the other Spaces. The 10 tarot cards are separated into two Spaces of five cards (10 cards total). One set are known as your INNATE TAROT. These Tarots represent all the effects that went into your creation and are beneficial to you. The other five cards are known as COUNTER TAROT. The counter tarot are the effects opposite those of your creation, and thus represent a negative force for your Character. At the first step of Character creation, each player should draw 5 cards from the Tarot Deck, one at a time. these cards will be your Innate Tarot for your Character. You may decide which of these five goes to which space (Major, Swords, Pentacles, Wands, Chalices) placing one card to each Space, before drawing the next. Then look to the chart below to determine that matching opposite card for your Counter Tarot Space. While drawing cards to determine Innate Tarot, always remove the opposite card after a card is pulled. This way you prevent have opposite cards as Innate Tarot. For example Azag as a Dire Orc has the card Hammu-Huziru (Strength VIII) as his Major Arcana, its opposite in Kismet is Maru-Huziru (Justice XIV), remove Maru-Huziru (Justice XIV) from the deck so that Azag cannot pull that card. Next Azag pulls another card, Lechus (The Fool 0) Azag puts this card in his Swords Space, this way if the Lechus (Fool 0) card is drawn as part of the daily tarot he gains a boon to his attack. Jeff also removes the Logius (The Magician I) from the deck since it is the opposite of the Lechus (The Fool 0) card and it goes into is Swords Counter Tarot Space.

## TAROT CHART

These Tarot are extremely flexible and interchangeable. Even within the base setting of Kismet certain cards change to reflect different races. For example, based on whether you believe in Elemental deities or Draconic deities the tarot will change accordingly. The Elemental deity is listed first, then the draconic deity in parenthesis. Feel free to add your own deities, or even those from ancient mythology as you see fit.

TAROT BONUS/PENALTIES

At the dawn of each day, a river of Tarot will be drawn (5 cards) These represent the flow of fate this day. If any of the cards that are drawn from the river match your innate Tarot cards then you get a TAROT BONUS. A Bonus is a numerical +1 Bonus you add statistic associated with that Space (see chart below). It is possible however that the cards drawn from the river of fate spell doom for a Character, this happens when a card is drawn that represents the opposite of one of your cards. When you get a card that matches one of your Counter Tarot, it is called a TAROT PENALTY, and it gives you a -1 to that type of statistic associated with that Space. Bonuses and Penalties “stack” with each other, meaning a Character can be affected by multiple. For example, if a Weaver draws a Character’s Major Arcana and their matching Innate Sword Tarot, that Character would have a total of +2 (+1 from the Sword Space Tarot, and +1 from the Major Arcana Space Tarot) to their attack rolls. This applies similarly to Penalties.

|                 BONUS                  |                PENALTY                 |
|:--------------------------------------:|:--------------------------------------:|
|       **Major:** +1 to all Rolls       |       **Major:** +1 to all Rolls       |
|     **Swords:** +1 to Attack Rolls     |     **Swords:** +1 to Attack Rolls     |
| **Pentacles:** +1 to all Defense Rolls | **Pentacles:** +1 to all Defense Rolls |
|          **Wands:** +1 Speed           |          **Wands:** +1 Speed           |
|      **Chalices:** +1 Skill Rolls      |      **Chalices:** +1 Skill Rolls      |


## TRUST FATE

Anytime you roll a dice you can Trust Fate instead. To Trust Fate is to draw cards from a shuffled Tarot deck one at a time until you pull one of either of your Innate Tarot or your Counter Tarot. Pulling an Innate Tarot means you have succeeded on the action, if the action was an Attack/Defense Roll the roll is a Critical Success/Failure. Pulling a Counter Tarot means you have failed on the action, if the action was an Attack/Defense Roll the enemy you are targeting Critically Succeeds or Critically Fails.  You cannot re-draw Tarot from trust Fate with RPP but can do so if an ability specifically allows you to do so.

 If you were to fall unconscious (by reaching 0 Hit Points) you must Trust Fate on each of your next turns to determine whether you stabilize or succumb to your injuries and die. If you pull an Innate Tarot you stabilize and are no longer at risk of dying from those injuries but are still at 0 Hit Points and are unconscious for an hour.  If you are stabilized and take damage again you still die (see Hit Points above). If you pull a Counter Tarot the Character dies from its injuries. If you pull a card that is neither an Innate or Counter Tarot you are still in the throes of fate and will have to Trust fate again on your next turn.
