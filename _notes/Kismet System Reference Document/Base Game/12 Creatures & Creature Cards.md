In the World of Amarant, exists a vast array  of creatures from small to large, to fantastic to horrifying. A full range of creatures and peoples and themes can be found in Amarant, from high fantasy to futuristic and everything in between.

## Creatures Types

there are ten types of Creatures in Kismet

[[Autonomous|AUTONOMOUS]], BEASTS, DRAGONS, ELDRITCH, ELEMENTALS, GIANTS, HUMANOIDS, MAGICAL BEASTS, PHAGES, UDUGS, UNDEAD, and the UNSEELIE

of these types, more thorough SPECIFIC TYPES exists as well such as [[Autonomous#Autonomous Androids Robots Androids Robots Levels 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10|Androids & Robots]] which are a specific type of [[Autonomous]] Creauture. 

## Creature Cards

Creature cards are quick templates that Players and Weavers can use to reference the statistics of creatures in the world of Amarant. 

#### WEAVER & PLAYER KNOWLEDGE OF CREATURES IN COMBAT

In Kismet, Players actually have some knowledge of the statistics and equipment of the creatures their Characters are observing. This knowledge represents all the surface observations of the creature that a Player can see, such as any equipment they are wearing, and how tough or strong that creature looks (shown by the Statistics such as [[2 CORE RULES#LEVEL|Level]], Attack, Damage, Armor value, Defenses etc...). However hidden knowledge such as what the creature's Abilities are or its Tactics and Disposition are not surface observations and will not be presented to Players. This knowledge is intentional and an integral part of playing Kismet. This allows for Players to have quicker, more engaging turns, that can be more easily planned ahead. It also lets Players have a greater understanding of the threats and environment around them.  However, some creatures are [[#VEILED CREATURES|VEILED]] and these creatures are creatures that have hidden statistics.  

#### VEILED CREATURES

[[#VEILED CREATURES|VEILED]] creatures are creatures whose statistics are entirely hidden from Players. Mostly, Weavers can use Veiled creatures to create a sense of unease such as when facing a difficult creature. Veiled creatures can also be used to create mystery and intrigue around a foreign or alien species for a creature that is the same or lower [[2 CORE RULES#LEVEL|Level]] than the Party.  All creatures Veiled or not, have their Statistics displayed in CREATURE CARDS as explained below.

In the sections below you will find the statistics of each creature represented by a card. The front side is the PLAYER’S SIDE it is used to show the values and statistics that all Players can see. The back is the WEAVER’S SIDE and it shows the hidden values such as Abilities, Tactics, and Dispositions. Veiled creatures do have Creature Cards but only the Weaver may observe a Veiled creature’s Creature Card unless the Player(s) can find a way to unveil a Veiled Creature. Weavers should bring out a creature’s Creature Card only when necessary, such as at the start of combat or if a Skill Roll is happening. Weavers do not need to deny access to Creature Cards at any time, although some groups may find them distracting if they are always available.  It is recommended but not necessary to have enough creature cards that each Player and the Weaver may observe them but groups can also function with just a single copy of a relevant Creature Card.

Creature Cards will also have the Unit Hit Points (on the Player’s Side) and some Key Rules (On the Weaver’s Side) should the Weaver decide to make the creature a Swarm. A same Creature Card can function for the individual or for a Swarm version of that particular creature.

#### READING CREATURE CARD STATISTICS

It is important to remember that other creatures and non-player characters will often not have to roll for their outcomes. Most will have a PASSIVE VALUE, which is essentially their Modifier +5; as if they had rolled a 5 on a ten-sided die. Thus, when studying a Creature Card for a [[2 CORE RULES#LEVEL|Level]] 1 creature it will likely have Attack, Defenses, and Skill Values that are a value of 5 or 6. This is because a [[2 CORE RULES#LEVEL|Level]] 1 creature will have a Modifier of +1 or +0, if they are Proficient or not Proficient respectively; and then the Passive Value or Roll of a 5 on a ten-sided dice is always added. Clever Weavers and Players will recognize that subtracting 5 from the values of Attack, Defenses, and Skill will give one the Modifier of any particular creature should the need arise to identify it.

Remember that a Player must “Meet or Beat '' to succeed on any particular roll they make. For example, if a [[2 CORE RULES#LEVEL|Level]] 1 creature wielding a shield has a Combat Defense of 7 (Passive Value of 5, [[2 CORE RULES#LEVEL|Level]] 1, +1 Shield Bonus) the total Value of the Roll (the Roll number and the Player’s modifier for that roll) must equal 7 or greater to successfully hit the creature. Creature Cards have the following, alphabetically listed Statistics written on them:

#### PLAYER’S SIDE:

ATTACK (PLAYER’S SIDE):

represents a creature's ability to successfully hit a target(s). This value is a Passive Value, meaning Players must roll an appropriate Defense Roll in response to this creature's Attacks or Abilities.

ARMOR VALUE (PLAYER’S SIDE):

represents a creature’s ability to resist incoming Damage. This functions identically to Armor value for Players. 

DAMAGE / DAMAGE TYPE (PLAYER’S SIDE):

represents how much Damage (before subtracting Armor Value) this creature will deal on a successful hit (a player’s or other creature’s failed appropriate Defense Roll)

DEFENSES (PLAYER’S SIDE):

 represents a creature's ability to successfully defend itself from other creatures or Player’s attacks and Abilities. This value is a Passive Value, meaning Players must roll an Attack Roll in order to overcome the creature’s Defenses.

EQUIPMENT / ENCUMBRANCE/ CARRYING CAPACITY/HIT THRESHOLDS (PLAYER’S SIDE):

represents any items or equipment the creature may have such as ammunition, amors, shields, weapons, foci, potions, etc. Encumbrance is how much a a load the creature is carrying.This functions Identically to Encumbrance / Carrying Capacity for Players. Hit Threshold is shown for all relevant equipment on the creature’s Attacks and Defenses.                      

HIT POINTS (PLAYER’S SIDE):

represents a creature's vitality and functions identically to Hit Points for Players. However, when a creature that is not a PLayer reaches 0 Hit Points they do not Trust Fate, they simply perish, or if the Player or Creature who struck the killing blow decides they would like to non-lethally attack the creature it is knocked unconscious instead. This functions identically to Hit Points for Players.

LEVEL (PLAYER’S SIDE):

represents generally how powerful a creature is. The Higher the [[2 CORE RULES#LEVEL|Level]] the more powerful the creature is. [[2 CORE RULES#LEVEL|Level]] is also the innate Modifier for Attacks, Defenses, Armor Value, Damage, and Skills, barring any additional equipment or Abilities that could be enhancing one of those statistics. This functions Identically to [[2 CORE RULES#LEVEL|Level]] for Players.

SIZE (PLAYER’S SIDE):

represents a creature’s Size. Size can be from 0-5, increasing how large the creature is. Sizes 0 - 1 take up only 1 Tile, while Sizes 2-5 take up their Size value squared in Tiles. Size also determines the creature's Reach, or how many Tiles (the Size Value equals the number of Tiles) from the edge of their own that they can touch or grab with their natural limbs. This functions Identically to Size for Players.

SPEED (PLAYER’S SIDE):

represents how much a creature can move in Tiles on its Turn. Some creatures will also have Non-Standard Movements such as Flight, Swim, or Climb Speeds, that apply only in those circumstances. This functions Identically to Speed for Players.

TIER OF POWER (PLAYER’S SIDE):

Like [[2 CORE RULES#LEVEL|Level]], Tier of Power is a way to determine generally how powerful a creature is. Tier of power can determine the strength of a creature's Abilities as well as how many additional Targets it can Cleave/Ranged Cleave. This functions identically to Tier of Power for Players.

#### WEAVER’S SIDE:

CREATURE TYPE (WEAVER’S SIDE):

Informs the Weaver of the creature’s Creature Type. Certain Abilities or effects may be used or have enhanced effects against creatures of  particular Creature Type.

DISPOSITION/ SOCIAL APPROVAL/AVERSION (WEAVER’S SIDE):

represents a creature's amiability or hostility towards the Players. This functions identically to Disposition for Players.

ENVIRONMENT (WEAVER’S SIDE):

represents one or more Environments in which a creature might be typically found in.

RESISTANCES (WEAVER’S SIDE):

represents any special Resistance a creature has to particular Damage Typings. Resistance is always a +2 Armor Value against the Resisted Damage Type. This functions identically to Resistance for Players.

SKILLS (WEAVER’S SIDE):

represents a creature's skill and knowledge. The Value for a creature's Skills is shown next to the Skills Title. This is a Passive Value for all of the creature’s Skills. If a particular Skill has any additional modifiers it will be written as (+x) to that Skill in the list.

SUB TYPE (WEAVER’S SIDE):

Some creatures are fusions or have the properties of  more than one type of creature.

TACTICS/DESCRIPTION (WEAVER’S SIDE):

represents what the typical strategies, motivations, and wants of the creature are. This is useful for Weavers as it informs them how they may typically act in combat or in general.

VULNERABILITIES (WEAVER’S SIDE):

represents any special weaknesses a creature may have to particular Damage Typings. The creature has a -2 Armor value to any Damage Type that it is Vulnerable to. This functions identically to Vulnerability for Players.
