=== end-multi-column

Kismet’s combat rules are designed for both speed and complexity, allowing for numerous choices of thought combat but keeping a fast pace that allows you to stay in the action. A term definition if soon to follow to expand on the rules but the basic rules are as follows

·        While kismet is a turn-based game, the Actions happen simultaneously

·        You roll against the Statistic listed on the Monster Card

·        You need to Meet to Beat a target number to succeed

·        If you reroll, you must accept the outcome of the new roll, even if it is lower or worse than the original roll.

Below in the Combat Rules section you will find a list of the terms and rules of combat, these entries are written in alphabetically instead of the order in which you might need them. This is so that these terms are easy to find and accessible.


## AID

 If you are within your unarmed melee range (0 Range for the Playable races) of an ally you can use a Major Action to Aid them in an action. You must be able to justify how you are actually helping your ally when you do so. You can aid allies on Attack, Defense or Skill Rolls. When you aid you add half (Rounded down (minimum 1) of your total Modifier to that type of Roll to their own roll (minimum 1).

## ARMOR VALUE  

As discussed in Chapter 2: Armor value represents your Characters ability resist Damage. Armor value equals your Character’s [[2 CORE RULES#LEVEL|Level]], but the amount can increase if the Character dons armor or has Abilities that increase it. Any damage taken by your Character or a Creature is reduced by the Armor Value they have, before reducing Hit Points. In the event that a Creature would take zero damage or less than zero damage due to Armor Value, the Creature still takes a minimum of 1 Damage. However, Creatures that are IMMUNE to a Damage Type do not take any Damage whatsoever from that Damage Type.

Armor Value prevents being damaged but also doesn’t let a Creature be healed as easily. A Creature always resists Healing by its Armor Value. If Healing were to be reduced to 0 or below 0 due to Armor Value, a minimum 1 Hit Point of healing is still done.

#### RESISTANCE AND VULNERABILITY AND IMMUNITY

RESISTANCE is the ability to take even less damage from certain damage types. When a Creature has resistance to a damage type it takes 2 less damage from that damage type. This reduction is also in addition to any reduction in damage received by Armor Value. For example, a Creature that has 3 armor value and fire resistance would reduce the damage of attacks with the fire damage type by 5 (5 = 3 from armor value + 2 from fire resistance). True Damage ignores a Creature’s resistance to a damage type, even if the true damage is dealing that type of damage. True damage always deals its set value of damage regardless of armor value or resistance.

VULNERABILITY is the ability of a Creature to take even more damage from certain damage types. When a Creature has a vulnerability to a damage type it takes an additional 2 damage from that type. In essence one can treat a Creature as having an armor value of 2 less than its normal value if it takes damage from a damage type it is vulnerable to. True Damage does not ignore a Creature’s vulnerability to a damage type, still dealing an additional 2 damage on top of the True Damage.

IMMUNITY is the ability of a Creature to take no damage from a particular damage type. A Creature that is immune cannot be dealt a single point of damage from a type of damage it is immune to.  A Creature that is immune to a damage type does not take the minimum 1 damage on a successful attack if it is immune to that damage type. Instead, and immune Creature will always take 0 damage from a damage type it is immune to. Even TRUE DAMAGE cannot deal damage to a Creature that is immune to the type of true damage being done.

## ATTACKS

Attack rolls are made in opposition to an Opponent’s Defenses. To be a successful to hit the Attack Roll must Meet to Beat the value of the Defense statistic of the Creature you are trying to hit. The roll of a 10 on an Attack Roll (just the dice roll, without including any additional modifiers) is a Critical Success. A Critical Success grants a +5 Bonus to the Value of the Attack Roll and WOUNDS the Creature if the Attack Roll is successful (See Chapter 10: Combat Rules: Wounds). On a roll a 1 on an Attack Roll (just the dice roll, without including any additional modifiers) the opponent your Character is facing has scored a Critical Success / you have Critically Failed Granting the Defender a +5 Bonus to their Defense Value and giving the Attacker the Stagger Condition (See Chapter 10: Combat Rules: Conditions for more information) if the Attack is unsuccessful.

## ATTACKING OPENINGS & THREAT RANGE

 In battle all Creatures are constantly looking for weaknesses or drops in an opponent’s guard. When this happens, a Creature can use its Reaction to make a Melee Attack against the Creature that dropped it’s guard. This is known as Attacking an Opening. When you Attack an Opening you cannot use Abilities that use a Melee Attack, you only make a Basic Melee Attack that does not benefit from Cleave. You can only Attack Openings within your Threat Range which is determined by the Reach of your melee weapon. Only melee weapons have a Threat Range, Ranged weapons and Foci do not unless they have the Melee Property. A Creature hit by an Opening Attack cannot move, use Abilities, or Attacks until the start of its next turn. Attacking an Opening always happens as soon as the Creature becomes open, but before the Creature can complete the action. Attacking an Opening interrupts, the Open Creature’s action and the Open Creature is unable to complete the action. Ongoing effects or Abilities from the previous round still continue as long as a successful Resolve Defense Roll to maintain Concentration, is made by the Creature hit by an Opening Attack (if appropriate). If a Creature performs one of the following actions while in melee range of you, it is considered Open

·        A Creature moves within your or outside of your Threat Range and did not use the GUARD action. A Creature is not Open when it first enters your Threat Range.

·        A Creature drinks a Potion or Interacts with an object

·        Drawing and sheathing a Weapon (However, it is a Free Action to drop a weapon from your hands and this does not leave you Open)

·        A Creature performs any Skill Roll that does not target an opponent. For example, using the Brawn Skill (assuming you are already within Reach) to Grapple an opponent would not leave you Open as your focus has not drifted from the battle. However while in combat, using the Medicine Skill to help an Ally with a Wound does leave you Open as your focus is away from the battle.  

·        The Creature uses a Ranged Weapon or Focus Attack while in ano0thert creature’s Melee Threat Range

·        Swinging, climbing, and swimming and other unique movement types, when one does not naturally have that Unique Movement Speed is considered to be Open. The creature wishing to Attack a Creature that is Open in this way must also Not be Open in the same manner. For example, Azag the Dire Orc is considered Open when Climbing a cliff face as he does not have a neutral Climb Speed, however his Wild Elf pursuers, while good climbers, also do not have a Climb Speed, and cannot Attack Azag’s Opening. If in this situation Azag were to be also pursued by Harpies, whom have a natural Flight Speed, the Harpies would be able to Attack Azag’s Opening when Climbing as they are not Open when flying next to the Cliff face.  

·        A Creature that stands up from Prone is considered Open. (Remember that it takes ½ of one’s Speed value to stand up from Prone, if a Creature is successfully Attacked while standing from Prone, they are interrupted and are set back to Prone again.)

## CLEAVE

Before making an Attack Roll with a Melee Attack or using an Ability that uses a Melee Attack that does not have an Area of Effect, you choose the number of targets to attack. You can attack a number of Creatures equal to your Tier or Power (see Below) that are in Reach/Range. 

### RANGED/ FOCUS CLEAVE

 When making a Ranged Attack (magical or non-magical) or using an Ability that uses a Ranged Attack that does not have an Area of Effect you must first select an _Initial Target_. You can choose a number of other Creatures to attack within 1 tile of your Initial Target for each Tier of Power you have above 1.

## CONCENTRATION

Strenuous tasks and long-lasting abilities often require a Creature’s Concentration to maintain. That is attention and focus that allows the effect to persist. To maintain Concentration on a task or Ability a Creature must use its Minor Action as the first Action on each of its turns. If a Creature that is maintaining Concentration on a task or Ability takes Damage, is put through a situation where it needs to make a Physical Skill Roll or other stressful situation the Weaver deems appropriate the Concentrating Creature needs to make a Resolve Defense Roll against a DL equal to the either of the Damage taken after subtracting Armor Value +5, or the DL of the Physical Skill Roll, whichever is higher.

If a Creature that is Concentrating uses a Minor Action for another Ability that requires Concentration, the first Ability is broken and the effect is lost. A Concentrating Creature can as a Free Action choose to simply stop Concentrating. For example, Azag the Dire Orc is holding onto a collapsing pillar, preventing his allies from being crushed. While he is doing so, he is struck from behind by his assailants, with a knife, dealing 6 Damage Azag. Azag subtracts his Armor Value of 3 from the Damage, leaving a total of 3 damage that went through. Azag now must make a Resolve Defense of DL 5 + damage taken or 3, for a total of DL 8 or drop the pillar. 

## CONDITIONS AND CONDITION LIST

Conditions are the various statuses of Creatures from being standard to poisoned, prone, restrained, or diseased. Below is a list of Conditions.

**Blind:** A Creature that is Blind cannot see and has a Penalty Die to attacking other Creatures and other Creatures have a Bonus Die to Attacking a Blinded Creature. 

**Charmed:** A Creature who Charms another Creature has a Bonus Die to Attack and Skill Rolls against the Charmed Creature’s Social Defense for the duration of the Charm effect. Charmed Creatures that take Damage have the Charmed Condition removed.

**Deaf:** A Deafened Creature cannot hear and automatically fails Perception Defense relying on hearing. Creatures that are Deafened are immune to Abilities that target a Creature in Earshot, such as _Bard_, _Gloat_, or _Born Leader._

**Diseased:** A Diseased Creature is actively suffering from a disease. Each Disease is unique in its Conditions (See Chapter 9: Adventuring Rules: Conditions and Conditions List, & Diseases)

**Ensorcelled:** a Creature with this Condition is under the effects of a mind or perception altering Ability, that will cause it to act in a certain manner. See the Ability that gave the Ensorcelled Condition for the specific behaviors of an Ensorcelled Creature.

**Frightened:** A Frightened Creature must try to flee from its source of fear using any of its attacks or abilities to do so. If any of these Attacks or Abilities target the source of fear the Frightened Creature has a Penalty Die to the Attack Roll. If a Frightened Creature cannot flee from or hide from its source of fear it is must stay still. Creatures that encounter their Phobias must make a Spirit Defense Roll against a DL of 9 or become Frightened. The Creature may remove the Frightened Condition by using a Major Action to re-roll their Spirit Defense (or have you re-roll your focus Attack Roll against their Spirit Defense). If the Creature’s Spirit Defense Roll is successful, it is free of the Frightened Condition.

**Paralyzed/Helpless:** A Paralyzed Creature cannot take any Actions other than thinking. Creatures have a Bonus Die to hit Paralyzed Creatures and any successful Attack done on a paralyzed Creature is a Critical Success. While a Creature can still think, it cannot concentrate on Abilities. 

**Pinned:** A Pinned Creature cannot escape from the grapple unless it has an Ability that allows it to. A Pinned Creature cannot move or take any action other than purely mental actions (this means a pinned Creature cannot escape a Pin by means of Skill Roll or using a Major Action to attempt to break the Pin).

**Poisoned:** a Poisoned Creature has a penalty die on Fortitude Defense, Attack Rolls and any Skill rolls that require physical action. 

**Prone:** A Prone Creature is laying down, Creatures attacking a Prone Creature in Melee Reach have a Bonus Die to their Attack Roll. In addition, a Prone Creature has a Penalty Die on Dodge Defense and can only crawl up to half its Speed. It can stand up using half of its total Speed to do so (it is open while standing up). Ranged attacks have a Penalty Die to attacking a Prone Creature, this includes Area of Effect Ranged Attacks.  

**Over-Encumbered:** An Over-Encumbered Creature is a Creature that has exceeded its Carrying Capacity. An Over-Encumbered Creature has its Speed set to 0.

**Restrained/Grappled:** a Restrained or Grappled Creature is being held in place. A Creature Attacking a Restrained Creature in Melee Reach has a Bonus Die to their Attack. Restrained Creatures cannot move unless they remove the Restraining effect or Creature holding them. Restrained Creatures can still make Attacks and Attack Open Creatures but do so at a Penalty die.

**Stunned:** A Stunned Creature skips its next Turn and cannot take any Actions or Movement, including Reactions. In addition, it loses Concentration on Abilities it was Concentrating on. The Creature can still roll Defense Rolls while Stunned. 

**Suffocating/Drowning:** A Creature is currently Suffocating or Drowning see Chapter 9: Adventuring Rules: Suffocation/Drowning for more information.

**Surprised:** A Creature is Surprised if they are unaware of another Creature’s presence. A Surprised Creature cannot use Reactions and they do not act during a Surprise Round. A Creature that attacks a Surprised Creature does so with a Bonus Die.

**Unconscious:** An unconscious Creature cannot perform any actions other than laying prone. A Creature that gets knocked unconscious remains so for at least 1 hour unless it is restored to at least 1 hit point (if the unconsciousness was caused by dropping to 0 hit points) or is awakened with smelling salts. Attackers gain a bonus die on unconscious Creatures, any damage an unconscious Creature takes kills it. Unconscious Creatures cannot be affected by Attacks or Abilities that requires Earshot.

## COVER

The environment can work with or against you as cover. Cover is when you are partially hidden or protected by a wall or other object, there are three kinds of cover, no cover when you are not protected, COVER is when you are partially hidden behind something at laest your Size or bigger than you, and FULL COVER when you are completely protected by a wall or object. The type of cover creates a miss chance for your opponents, if a Creature attacks you when you are behind cover you gain a Bonus Die to your Defense Rolls to any attacks or Abilities that do not ignore cover or do not have the Instantaneous Projectile types (see Below Chapter 10: Combat Rules: Projectile Types). You cannot target a Creature that has Full Cover unless you have an attack or Ability that allows you to target Creatures that are Covered, or an attack or Ability that has the Instantaneous Projectile Type. To target a Creature behind Full Cover you must find a way to know their exact location.

Conventional Cover is a term you will see in some Abilities, typically conventional cover is cover that protects either your front or your back but not beneath or above you. Some Abilities ignore conventional cover (such as _Lightning Strike_ Ability) but would still be subject to cover if something provided cover from above or below you.

A creature may have Cover while behind another creatures of its own Size or Larger, however the creatures that are part of the Tiles of a Swarm do not benefit from Cover from other members of its own Swarm.

## DAMAGE & HEALING

The Damage value is the amount you subtract off of a Creature’s hit points if your Character successfully hit them with an attack. Your base damage is your Character’s [[2 CORE RULES#LEVEL|Level]]+4, meaning any attacks, punches, abilities, or spells deal that much damage, however this amount can increase when using weapons or magical foci as stated in the equipment’s statistics (See Chapter 8: Equipment, Gear, & Economy). When dealing damage, subtract the victim’s ARMOR VALUE (see below) from your attacker’s damage value to determine how much to subtract from the victim’s HP. 

Healing works Identically to damage in Kismet, except that it restores Hit Points instead of removing them. Healing is also resisted by Armor Value just like Damage is.

#### TRUE DAMAGE & HEALING

True Damage is damage that does not have Armor Value subtracted from its value and directly removes Hit Points from a Creature. True Damage is still affected by RESISTANCE, and VULNERABILITY (see below). If a Creature has IMMUNITY to the True Damage, then it deals no damage. True Damage cannot be increased by effects that increase Damage. The exception to this rule is the additional 2 damage from a Critical Success. If you get a Critical Success with an Attack or Ability that deals True Damage you deal an additional 2 True Damage of the same type of Damage and inflicts a Wound on the Creature.

True Healing works identically to True Healing, except that it restores Hit Points instead of Removing them.

#### DAMAGE TYPES

Damage types are the ways that Creatures can come to harm. For example, the burns received from a flaming explosion differ from the open cuts of a sword. In Kismet the magical damage types produce tangible effects. Fire damage produces flames that can ignite objects and Creatures on fire, water damage does produce water that soaks a Creature and so on. The magic is produced directly from the Focus not from the environment. The list of possible damage types in Kismet are:

**Air:** Air can buffet or cut a Creature against howling winds, suffocate them, or creates loud bursts of sound that damage ear drums and rattles bones and organs.  

**Arcane:** Arcane is the raw magical energy that is concentrated to bring harm. 

**Bludgeoning:**  Bludgeoning damage is impact from blunt force trauma or weapons.

**Chopping:** Chopping is damage that attempts to separate and create pieces or chunks off an object or Creature. Seen in commonly in curved blades like those of axes and scimitars.

**Cold:** Cold is harm cause from rapid changes of internal and nearby temperatures or physical trauma with ice.

**Earth:** Earth is damage from minerals that can cause different types of physical trauma, crystallization, or petrification.

**Fire:** Fire damage is caused from the intense heat, leading to burns and melting substances.

**Lightning:** Caused by electricity and magnetism surging through a Creature’s body.

**Nature:** Nature damage is caused by or through living things. It is damage caused by the disruption of the natural cycles in one’s body, or by calling upon already living entities like plants, animals, and the living life energy of spirits long ago.

**Piercing:** Piercing damage usually involves a small point of force that moves through a Creature or object, like spears, arrows, and rapiers.

**Psychic:** Psychic is the force of mind, it can deal damage through bursts of energy, attacking another’s mind, memories, or self-image. 

**Radiant:** Radiant is like a plasma, similar to fire or lightning that stems from the positive power of celestials like angels and physical wavelengths of light.

**Slicing:** Slicing is using a fine edge to make a long cuts and lacerations. Such as damage from weapons with straight edges like longswords and whips.

**Stygian:** Stygian is like a plasma, similar to fire or lightning that stems from the negative power of demons, devils, and oppressive, inky darkness.

**Toxic:** Toxic is damage from poisons, toxins, disease, and rot. Caustic acids, All manner of bacteria, viruses, and plagues fall under Toxic damage as well.

**Water:** Water is damage from the crushing pressure and violent waves, drowning, and dehydration. Water created from Foci and innate magic is pure elemental water and harmful to a Creature’s health and should not be consumed. 

There terms in this list will always be followed by one of either of the terms “Damage” or “Healing”. As explained above the damage term means that Hit Points are being Reduced and the Healing term means that Hit Points are being restored. The Damage and Healing terms are not exclusive to any particular damage type, for example you can have both Radiant Healing and Radiant Damage the same way you can have Fire healing and Fire Damage. 

When substances types are created from foci (such as water, earth, or fire) temporarily create substances seemingly from nowhere. However, the element that is created is momentary and lasts just long enough for the attack or ability to manifest. They do not linger after the attack or ability has been resolved unless the attack or ability specifically states that it does.

## CONFINED SPACES

Confined Spaces are spaces where you don’t have enough room to effectively fight with your weapons. You need your weapons melee range plus 1 tile to not be in a cramped space. For example, if you have a sword with a range of 1 tile and you are in a corridor that is 3 tiles wide (with you in the 2nd or middle tile) you are in a Confined Space. If you attack in a Confined Space, then you have a Penalty Die on your Attack Roll. See example below for spacing. If a weapon has the Short Property, it ignores Confined Spaces and can fight without penalty in that range. Note that Confined Space only applies if there is something to hamper your fighting such as walls, tables, chairs or even large urban crowds. Fighting Creatures (even if they are surrounding you) in an open field or wide space is not considered Confined Spaces. Caves, Castle halls and indoor fighting have a chance to be a Confined Spaces.

Ex: you are represented by the black square

Areas labelled in grey are cramped for you with a weapon with a range of 1  

## DEFENSES

As discussed in Chapter 2: Statistics, There are 7 types of defenses, Combat, Fortitude, Dodge, Resolve, Perception, Social, and Spirit, each defending you from different types of Attacks and Abilities. The roll of a 10 on a Defense Roll (just the dice roll, without including your modifier) is a Critical Success on a Defense grants +5 to the total Value of the Defense Roll and if the Attack is unsuccessful the Attacker is also given the Staggered Condition. (See chapter 10: Combat Rules: Conditions for more information). The roll of a 1 on a Defense Roll (just the dice roll, without including your Modifier) is your Character suffering from a Critical Failure / you receive a Critical Attack from an opponent, increasing the Value of their Attack roll by +5 and your Character gains a Wound if the Attack is successful against you. More details of the seven defenses are below:

**Combat:** Combat defense is a Defense represents a combination of timing, distance, small dodges, parrying, blocking with shields and armor. Creatures that do not use any kind of tools, weapons, or armor are generally not Proficient Combat Defense.

**Dodge:** Dodge Defense represents your ability to jump, dive, duck or roll out of the way of deadly effects, Area of Effect Abilities, explosions, and other effects that cannot simply be side-stepped. 

**Fortitude:** Fortitude Defense represents your ability to withstand crushing blows, poisons, diseases, as well as your endurance and constitution. 

**Perception:** Perception defense represents how sharp your senses are at detecting those that wish to remain unseen as well as your ability to see through illusions and Traps.

**Resolve:** Resolve Defense represents your intellectual prowess and willpower and is used to defend against mental attacks or abilities that would cause you to act against your will. Resolve defense is used by Characters to concentrate on long lasting abilities (See Chapter 9 Combat Rules: Concentration)

**Social:** Social Defense represents your ability to see through lies, flattery or other social manipulations. This Defense also allows you to interpret signals from a Creature’s words, body language or actions it takes to determine the underlying intention of the Creature. You can roll a Social Defense Roll against the Creature’s Bluff or Persuasion or Intimidate or Leadership or Taunt Skill Roll (the Weaver will choose one based on the Creature’s intention, if the Creature is lying or not being entirely truthfully for example, Bluff would be appropriate). If you succeed you are correctly made aware of the Creature’s intentions towards you, if you fail you are either unsure of the Creature’s intentions or incorrectly assume a Creature’s intentions depending on what is most appropriate for the situation. 

  
**Spiritual:** Spiritual Defense represents your conviction to stick to your morality (or immortality), beliefs, or within one’s self or personhood, resisting fear, as well as tests of faith or against divine forces and attacks.

#### PASSIVE DEFENSES

As discussed above in Chapter 2: Statistics, when a Player is not making an active Defense Roll, but still needs to defend themselves, They use Passive Defense. A Passive Defense is the Creature or Player’s Defense value +5.  For example, A [[2 CORE RULES#LEVEL|Level]]2 Creature Proficient in Perception Defense would have a Passive Perception Defenses of 7 (5 + 2 from its Proficiency). For most adversaries the Party will face, the Weaver will use the Passive Defense Values and a static Passive Attack Value for the Party to roll against.

## FLANKING

It is frequent that a Creature or Character may be outnumbered, but it is a particularly bad situation when a Creature or Character is assaulted on opposing ends. When two Creatures, with melee weapons, can draw a straight line that runs through them and through a foe, that foe is considered Flanked. Players attacking a flanked Creature have a Bonus Die to do so, Creatures or Players that are Flanked have a Penalty Die to any Defense Rolls, Attacks made by the Creatures that are Flanking them. Creatures that are Larger in Size may be flanked in ways smaller Creature cannot be, see the figures below for some examples of Flanking.

## GRAPPLING

  Grappling is a term used to refer to when one Creature grabs another Creature. As a Major Action you can attempt to grab another Creature in your unarmed reach when you do make an Attack Roll against their Combat Defense if successful you have grabbed that Creature (this does not deal damage). The Creature that is Grappled suffers from the Restrained condition. As a Major Action, the Grappler can choose to push its victim 1 Tile in any direction or force them prone. When forcing the victim Prone the Creature can choose to maintain its Grapple, if the victim is pushed the Grapple is broken. You may attempt to Grapple a Creature of any Size, but Creatures that are larger in Size value than you have a Bonus Die to Attack and Defense Rolls when Grappling, Pinning, or Strangling (see below).

A Creature who is Grappling another Creature has Cover from Attacks and Abilities if the Creature being held is the same Size as the Grappling Creature. If the Creature being held is Larger in Size that the Creature Grappling it, the Grappling Creature has Full Cover. 

A Creature who is Grappling another Creature who takes damage must make another Attack Roll against the Grappled Creatures’ Combat Defense to maintain the Grapple.

When Grappling a Creature, you can attempt to Pin the Creature as a Major Action, putting it in a type of lock or hold that it cannot escape from. To do so you can use your Major Action to make an Attack Roll against the Grappled Creature’s Combat Defense, if successful the Creature is Pinned. A Pinned Creature cannot escape from the Grapple unless it has an ability that allows it to. A Pinned Creature cannot move or take any action other than purely mental actions (this means a pinned Creature cannot escape a Pin by means of Skill Roll or using a Major Action to attempt to break the Pin). The Grappling Creature also cannot move from its position if it has a Pinned Creature, moving releases the victim from the Pin (although it is still Grappled). Both the Grappler and the victim suffer from the Restrained Condition during the pin.

Another option a Grappler can use on its victim is STRANGLING the victim. The Grappler can use its Major Action to attempt to Strangle the Grappled victim, the Grappler must make an Attack Roll against the victim’s Fortitude Defense Roll, the Creature goes into the Suffocated/Drowning Condition (See in Chapter 9: Adventuring Rules: Suffocating/Drowning)

### SCALING CREATURES

You may use a Grapple to climb onto a Creature that is at least 2 Sizes larger than you. This is called Scaling a Creature. To Scale a Creature, you can make a Grapple attempt (Roll a melee weapon Attack Roll or initiate a Grapple through an Ability) with the intention of Scaling the Creature rather than grabbing them. if successful, you latch on to them.

When attempting to Scale a Creature, the larger Creature does not gain a Bonus Die to its Combat Defense against the Scaling attempt due to a difference in Size, unlike a regular Grapple Roll.

Once you have started Scaling the larger Creature, you can move on it using your climbing speed (if you do not have a climbing speed, it is ½ your land Speed or Basic Speed, rounded down). One can Also roll an Athletics Skill Roll for Scaling as a part of their Movement Action with a DL equal to the larger Creature’s [[2 CORE RULES#LEVEL|Level]]+5, if successful the Scaling Creature can move their full Speed while Scaling the larger Creature. Treat each of the larger Creatures’ Tiles it occupies as its own Tile for movement while Scaling.

While Scaling, you have a Bonus Die to Attack Rolls on the Creature you are Scaling.

While Scaling, a Creature you have Full Cover against Attacks and Abilities that do not have line of sight of you Scaling the Creature.

While Scaling it, the larger Creature cannot target you with Attacks or Abilities that do not reach 0 Range.

To remove a Scaling Creature, the larger Creature must try to Grapple the Scaling Creature, however the larger Creature does not get a Bonus Die to escape the Grapple/Scaling based on its Size. If the larger Creature is successful in grabbing the Scaling Creature The Scaling Creature is no longer Scaling but simply Grappled by the larger Creature.

## GUARD ACTION

As a Major action you can Guard, when you take the Guard Action you can make a Movement Action without being Open and you have a Bonus Die to any Defense Rolls you make until the start of your next turn.

## INITIATIVE

At the beginning of every round of combat (except Surprise Rounds) a Turn order needs to establish. Turn order in Kismet is decided by Tarot card draws. Simply have Creature (Payers included) involved in combat draw a card from the Tarot deck. The highest number gets to move first and turn order follows a descending pattern.  Remember to put cards back into the deck incase a Player needs to Trust Fate. Players get to draw first, after a Player has drawn a card, an opposing Creature gets to draw a card. This Tarot Card Drawing Alternates until all Players and Creatures have a drawn. The Players must determine which order they would like to draw Tarot in, and similarly the Weaver chooses in which order the opposing Creatures draw Tarot. At the end of a Creature or Players turn, the Weaver or that Player should draw from the Tarot deck to determine when their next Turn is in the following Round before the next Creature or Player’s Turn.

Remember that drawing from the Tarot for Initiative is how A Weaver Determines If a Circumstance Boon or Circumstance Bane comes into effect.

## INTERACT WITH AN OBJECT

 Interacting with an Object is something that can be done as either a Major or a Minor Action or both (to Interact with an Object twice in the same turn or interact with two Objects) on your own Turn. Examples include Drinking a potion, pulling a lever, hitting a switch, picking the lock of a door, sheathing a weapon while drawing a new one, picking up an unconscious person or dropped object etc. 

## MINDLESS CREATURES

Mindless Creatures are Creatures that are not truly sentient nor lucid. This do es not mean that they are not necessarily alive nor that they are incapable of making decisions but they are either: devoid of reason, unable to communicate using a language, unthinking, or has no will of its own. The reason for the Mindlessness of a Mindless Creature is dependent entirely upon the Creature. Creatures that are Mindless will have the Mindless property written on their Monster Card. For example, Beasts such as dogs, and Tigers are not Mindless as they can reason, be trained, or make decisions, however Creatures like certain Zombies or Automatons that can only act on orders are examples of Mindless Creatures.

Mindless Creatures are unaffected by Social Skills or Attacks and Abilities that target Social Defense.

## PROJECTILE TYPES

There are two main projectile types, STANDARD PROJECTILE and INSTANT PROJECTILE**.** A Standard Project as a physical form and when fired is subject to Cover. Examples would be arrows, throwing weapons, standard magical attacks. Instant projectiles are ranged attacks that suddenly appear without having a travel time such as Psychic attacks, the _Down Draft_ Ability, and other such Abilities. Instant Projectiles attacks and Abilities ignore all forms of Cover. It will be noted in the Ability whether the attack is Standard Projectile or Instant Projectile, if it does not state in the ability which type of projectile it is, assume it is a Standard Projectile.

## READIED ACTION

A Creature can choose to use its Major and/or Minor actions to delay a Major and/or Minor actions to activate after a set trigger. For example, a Creatures lies in wait behind a door ready to attack the first Player who opens the door.  This is called a Readied Action. While making a Readied Action that Creature cannot Attack Openings, use Reactions, can only continue to concentrate on Abilities if it did not ready its Minor Action to use ready another Ability. If the specific trigger of the Readied Action(s) does not occur the Creature who Readied the Actions does not perform those action and can perform no other actions until its next turn. 

## ROUGH TERRAIN

Rough terrain is terrain that is difficult to traverse such as a thick tangle of vines, jungle floor, rooted or rocky pathways, or ground that has a minor obstacle such as broken glass, caltrops and other minor hazards. When you enter rough terrain each tile you move through counts as 2 tiles from your speed, meaning that you move twice as slow through it.

## ROUND

 A Round in combat lasts approximately 10 seconds and consists of every Creature in combat taking its Turn.  At the start of each Round every Creature must draw from the Tarot to determine its turn order in the Initiative. Once every Creature in combat has taken its Turn the Round is over and a new Round begins.

## SHIELD ALLY

 If you are within Melee Reach of an allied Creature you can use your Reaction when that ally is attacked to step in the way of the defense. When you do the attack targets you instead of your ally and you roll your Defense as appropriate for the attack. If the attack is an area of effect if and you use the Shield Ally action, the area of effect attack has a Bonus Die to hit you but a Penalty Die to Hit the ally you are shielding.

## SURPRISE ROUND

 A Surprise Round is a turn of combat before combat officially begins. Surprise Rounds is done by attacking a Creature when they are unaware of your presence. In this case the defending Creature cannot use its Reactions and the attacking Creature has a Bonus Die to Attacking a surprised Creature. A Surprised Creature does not take a turn in a Surprise Round. Attacking a Creature regardless of success makes it aware to combat and once the Surprise Round ends start combat as you normally would. Once a Creature has been Surprised it cannot be Surprised by the same Creatures or Players again as long as it is aware that those Creatures or Players are in the vicinity. If a Creature cannot pinpoint your location but is aware that it is not alone or knows that a Creature or player is in hiding it is still no Surprised, but the Attacker still receives a Bonus die to attacking from hiding.

## SWARM COMBAT

Swarms are mass of several Creatures forced together in a mob. Swarm Encounters are encounters in which the Party has to face at least one Swarm. Swarms not handled efficiently can create dangerous scenarios for players. Swarms are broken down into Units and Formation. In a Swarm a UNIT refers to an individual Creature or Tile that is a part of the Swarm.  A FORMATION refers to the Entirety of the Swarm. For the Purposes of Targeting, treat each Tile of a Swarm as its own Creature, for example, when determining Cleave Targets, each Tile of a Swarm would count as a single Creature. Swarms act as a single Formation and only have one Turn in the Initiative. A Swarm must start as a minimum of five Units each of whom must be adjacent to (within 1 Tile of each other so that the miniature’s bases are touching) at least one other Unit by an edge or corner of their Tile. This number can decrease as the Swarm takes damage or chooses to separate (see Below in Swarm Traits). Further, Swarms take on all of the following Statistics of the lowest[[2 CORE RULES#LEVEL|Level]]; or lowest Statistics of the members of the Swarm for the following Statistics: Attack, Armor Value, all Defenses, Speed, and Damage. Weavers can consider a Formation of a five Unit Swarm equivalent to a single Creature of the same [[2 CORE RULES#LEVEL|Level]] for Encounter building purposes, for example a [[2 CORE RULES#LEVEL|Level]] 3 Creature is equivalent to a [[2 CORE RULES#LEVEL|Level]] 3 Swarm made of five Units. Below are some of the properties of Swarms:

·        The Swarm moves as one whole, but each Unit in the Formation can move on its own with the same Speed value as the Formation as a whole. However, individual Units cannot break apart from the swarm (be more that 1 tile away from another Unit of the Formation).

·       A Swarm itself has no Hit Points value, but each Unit of the Swarm has 5 Hit Points, each time a Unit of a Swarm is reduced to 0 Hit Points remove that tile from the swarm and count it as defeated. If hit by an Area of Effect or a weapon that can hit more than one Unit (such as with the Cleave Property) Only the targeted Units take damage or are removed from the swarm.

o   A Swarm that consists of Creatures that are Size 2 or larger each have 1 additional Hit Point for every Size Beyond Size 1 They possess. In this way a Size 2 Swarm Unit has 6 Hit Points and a Size 5 Swam Unit has 9 Hit Points

o   A Swarm has only one Reaction each Round, but it can Always Attack an Opening without using its Reaction. In so meaning, a Swarm has an infinite number of times in a Round that it can Attack an Opening.

o   A Swarm using an Attack or Ability can always target every Creature in its Reach or Range with each of its attacks and abilities.

o   A Swarm can separate if individual Creatures deem it wise to do so. With a Minor Action an Allied Creature of the Swarm can join or separate from the Swarm.

o   A Swarm has access to any of the Abilities of the individual Creatures that make up the Swarm, but still only has one Major, Minor, and Movement action as any individual Creature would in one Turn.

o   If a Unit of a Swarm becomes Restrained, Paralyzed, Stunned, has its Speed set to 0, or is otherwise unable to move it is automatically separated from its Swarm and becomes a single Tile swarm.

o   A Swarm interacts with a Siege Weapon, If it uses any Actions to operate the Siege Engine fulfills all of the number of Actions required to operate the Siege Engine. However, a Swarm donating its Actions to a Siege Engines means that it cannot use those Actions to do other things on their Turn.

When trying to determine the Experience Points and Difficulty of a Swarm when Encounter building (see Chapter 11: Experience, Encounters & Dungeon Building) count every Unit of a swarm is its [[2 CORE RULES#LEVEL|Level]] in Experience Points, and Swarms should be initially created with at Least five Units in the formation (for example a [[2 CORE RULES#LEVEL|Level]] 1 swarm would be 1 experience for each Tile for a total of 5 experience, which is equivalent to a [[2 CORE RULES#LEVEL|Level]] 1 Creatures.

At the Weaver’s discretion to make Swarms as large as they like but must consider the ability of the party to handle them. Parties with many Area of Effects will have an easier time against Swarms, but Parties without access to Area of Effects may find it difficult to fight them. 

## TURN

An Individuals Creatures time to take its actions in the full Round (see Below). On its Turn it may take a Major Action, a Minor Action, Movement Action, Free Actions in any order it chooses. Further, It may take a Reaction on its turn or save that Reaction for another Creature’s turn, but a Creature only has one reaction per Round. 

 Remember that, at the end of a Creature or Players turn, the Weaver or that Player should draw from the Tarot deck to determine when their next Turn is in the following Round, before the next Creature or Player’s Turn.

## WOUNDS

Wounds are specific and traumatic injuries that physically hamper a Creature or player in some way. Many Wounds are deadly if not treated quickly, however not all are fatal. Wounds are injuries that go beyond the bounds of hit points. For example, it is possible to have full hit points but have a broken leg. A Wound cannot always be healed the way hit point loss can be, for example Radiant Healing cannot cure them. Wounds often require proper Medicine, expensive potions, or specialized powers to heal. In addition, when you receive a Wound, you also gain one level of Exhaustion. When a Critical Success is rolled (a player rolls a 10 on their Attack Roll or a 1 on their Defense Roll), you roll for a Wound randomly on the Wound Chart below. Wounds can come from any Damage source. Weaver’s discretion and description can allow for any wound to take place. For example, to describe _Horrific Scar / Disfigurement_ Wound from Water Damage the Weaver or Player may say the magic was conjured as a blade of water. See the list of Wounds below.

To determine a DL of a Wound (if it has one) use the DL values of the Remedial/Lethality Tiers equivalent to the Attacking Creature’s Tier of Power. For Example, A [[2 CORE RULES#LEVEL|Level]] 4 Creature (Tier of Power 2) Critically injures another Creature with a Slicing weapon and gives it the Bleeding Wound. The DL to staunch the Bleeding would be the same as a lethality Tier 2 poison or DL 9. This is because The Attacking Creature’s Tier of Power (2) be equal to the Lethality Tier (2).

| 1-5  | Damage Type Specific Wound  | Give a Wound that is specific to the damage type you dealt with the Critical Success or Attack that gave the Wound. If you do multiple damage types in this Attack you choose which of the Damage Type’s Specific Wounds occurs.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| 6    | Horrific scar/disfigurement | This Wound is not fatal, but a horrific scar or disfigurement appears that gives the Creature a penalty die to using social Skills (other than intimidate) as other Creature’s find the victim’s appearance hideous and unbearable to look at. No Medicine Skill Roll can be made to undo the scar, however, can be healed magically such as with the **_Restoration_** or similar ability or a potion of restoration.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| 7    | Festering Wound             | A Creature that suffers a festering wound that needs a DL equal to the DL on the Difficulty Tier Table of the Creature who inflicted the Wound’s Tier of Power Medicine Skill Roll performed every 24 hours from receiving the wound.  Failure to do so or failure to meet the DL causes the Creature to gain a level of exhaustion and the poisoned condition. Each day that the Medicine Skill Roll is not made or is failed adds another level of exhaustion. After 5 successful Medicine Skill Rolls (does not need to be consecutive) the infection is cleared, and the wound heals.                                                                                                                                                                 |
| 8    | Stagger                     | A Creature suffers a mighty blow and becomes unable to act for one turn. While Staggered the Creature can make no actions and all attacks have a Bonus Die to hit it. A Staggered Creature automatically loses Concentration it was maintaining. Staggered Creatures are Vulnerable to all Damage Types while Staggered, if they were already vulnerable to a Damage Type these weaknesses stack for a total of an additional 4 damage (2 from Vulnerable + 2 from Staggered)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| 9    | Disable Sense               | A Creature that suffers from a disabled sense and the Creature loses one of its sensing organs (such as an eye or ear). The organ it loses is the attacking Creature’s choice. A Creature missing one of its sensing organs becomes blind or deaf for 1 round. After that it has a penalty die to Perception Defense and other Skills that rely on either sight or listening. If the Creature does not have standard senses (such as it may not have sight, but it could have a blind sense or a tremor sight), it loses the organ responsible for that type of sense and gains the blind condition even if its normally cannot be blinded. A DL 16 Medicine Skill Roll can restore the organ if it is done within 3 rounds of having the sense disabled. |
| 10   | Fatal blow                  | A Creature that suffers a fatal blow dies instantly as it is beheaded or in some other way mortally wounded.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |

If a leg is Dismembered or Disabled, the Creature’s speed is reduced to ½ its normal speed, falls prone and it has a penalty die to any dodge defense it tries to make. If a Creature has multiple limbs or other limbs (such as a tail) the attacker can choose to Dismember or Disable that limb, treating it as an arm or leg as is appropriate. If a Creature has more than 2 of one type of limb (such as a spider) assume enough of the limbs are Dismembered or Disabled to cause the effects of a Dismembered or Disable limb to happen. If the Creature has no limbs, roll for a different Wound. A Dismembered Creature needs to make a Medicine Skill Roll against the attacker’s Lethality Tier DL attempt to reattach the limb and the limb must be salvaged within one minute of its Dismemberment / Disablement or until the effect is removed. |

The limb that is Frostbitten is of the attacking Creature’s choice. If a Creature has multiple limbs or other limbs (such as a tail) the attacker can choose to inflict Frostbite on that limb, treating it as an arm or leg as is appropriate. If a Creature has more than 2 of one type of limb (such as a spider) assume enough of the limbs are Frostbitten to cause the effects of a Frostbitten limb to happen. If the Creature has no limbs, roll for a different Wound. At the start of each of the victim’s turns, an additional limb (chosen by the attacker) also succumbs to the Frostbite Wound. A Frostbitten Creature needs to make or have a Creature perform a DL 9 Medicine Skill Roll within one minute of receiving this wound to heal the limbs or the limbs are lost until the effect is removed through the R_estoration_ Ability or a Potion of Restoration. The victim also gains one level of Exhaustion.

If an arm is Frostbitten, the arm cannot hold or use any equipment, gear or natural weapon’s.

## **COMBAT RULES ANCLLARY A: CREATURE CARDS**

In this Ancillary Chapter you will find information regarding a feature of Kismet called Creature Cards. Creature cards are quick templates that Players and Weavers can use to reference the statistics of Creatures in the world of Amarant. 

## WEAVER & PLAYER KNOWLEDGE OF CREATURES IN COMBAT

In Kismet, Players have some knowledge of the statistics and equipment of the Creatures their Characters are observing. This knowledge represents all the surface observations of the Creature that a Player can see, such as any equipment they are wearing, and how tough or strong that Creature looks (shown by the Statistics such as [[2 CORE RULES#LEVEL|Level]], Attack, Damage, Armor value, Defenses etc...). However hidden knowledge such as what the Creature's Abilities are, or its Tactics and Disposition are not surface observations and will not be presented to players. This knowledge is intentional and an integral part of playing Kismet. This allows for Players to have quicker, more engaging turns, that can be more easily planned ahead. It also lets Players have a greater understanding of the threats and environment around them.  However, some Creatures are VEILED, and these Creatures are Creatures that have hidden statistics.  

### VEILED CREATURES

Veiled Creatures are Creatures whose statistics are entirely hidden from Players. Mostly, Weavers can use Veiled Creatures to create a sense of unease such as when facing a difficult Creature. Veiled Creatures can also be used to create mystery and intrigue around a foreign or alien species for a Creature that is the same or lower [[2 CORE RULES#LEVEL|Level]] than the Party.  All Creatures Veiled or not, have their Statistics displayed in CREATURE CARDS as explained below.

In the sections below you will find the statistics of each Creature represented by a card. The front side is the PLAYER’S SIDE it is used to show the values and statistics that all Players can see. The back is the WEAVER’S SIDE and it shows the hidden values such as Abilities, Tactics, and Dispositions. Veiled Creatures do have Creature Cards but only the Weaver may observe a Veiled Creature’s Creature Card unless the Player(s) can find a way to unveil a Veiled Creature. Weavers should bring out a Creature’s Creature Card only when necessary, such as at the start of combat or if a Skill Roll is happening. Weavers do not need to deny access to Creature Cards at any time, although some groups may find them distracting if they are always available.  It is recommended but not necessary to have enough Creature cards that each Player and the Weaver may observe them but groups can also function with just a single copy of a relevant Creature Card.

Creature Cards will also have the Unit Hit Points (on the Player’s Side) and some Key Rules (On the Weaver’s Side) should the Weaver decide to make the Creature a Swarm. A same Creature Card can function for the individual or for a Swarm version of that particular Creature.

### READING CREATURE CARD STATISTICS

It is important to remember that other Creatures and non-player Characters will often not have to roll for their outcomes. Most will have a PASSIVE VALUE, which is essentially their Modifier +5; as if they had rolled a 5 on a ten-sided die. Thus, when studying a Creature Card for a [[2 CORE RULES#LEVEL|Level]] 1 Creature it will likely have Attack, Defenses, and Skill Values that are a value of 5 or 6. This is because a [[2 CORE RULES#LEVEL|Level]] 1 Creature will have a Modifier of +1 or +0, if they are Proficient or not Proficient respectively; and then the Passive Value or Roll of a 5 on a ten-sided dice is always added. Clever Weavers and Players will recognize that subtracting 5 from the values of Attack, Defenses, and Skill will give one the Modifier of any particular Creature should the need arise to identify it.

Remember that a Player must “Meet to Beat '' to succeed on any particular roll they make. For example, if a [[2 CORE RULES#LEVEL|Level]] 1 Creature wielding a shield has a Combat Defense of 7 (Passive Value of 5, [[2 CORE RULES#LEVEL|Level]] 1, +1 Shield Modifier) the total Value of the Roll (the Roll number and the Player’s modifier for that roll) must equal 7 or greater to successfully hit the Creature. Creature Cards have the following, alphabetically listed Statistics written on them:

### PLAYER’S SIDE:

ATTACK (PLAYER’S SIDE):

represents a Creature's ability to successfully hit a target(s). This value is a Passive Value, meaning Players must roll an appropriate Defense Roll in response to this Creature's Attacks or Abilities.

ARMOR VALUE (PLAYER’S SIDE):

represents a Creature’s ability to resist incoming Damage. This functions identically to Armor value for Players. 

DAMAGE / DAMAGE TYPE (PLAYER’S SIDE):

represents how much Damage (before subtracting Armor Value) this Creature will deal on a successful hit (a player’s or other Creature’s failed appropriate Defense Roll)

DEFENSES (PLAYER’S SIDE):

 represents a Creature's ability to successfully defend itself from other Creatures or Player’s attacks and Abilities. This value is a Passive Value, meaning Players must roll an Attack Roll in order to overcome the Creature’s Defenses.

EQUIPMENT / ENCUMBRANCE/ CARRYING CAPACITY/HIT THRESHOLDS (PLAYER’S SIDE):

represents any items or equipment the Creature may have such as ammunition, amors, shields, weapons, foci, potions, etc. Encumbrance is how much a a load the Creature is carrying. This functions Identically to Encumbrance / Carrying Capacity for Players. Hit Threshold is shown for all relevant equipment on the Creature’s Attacks and Defenses.                          

HIT POINTS (PLAYER’S SIDE):

represents a Creature's vitality and functions identically to Hit Points for Players. However, when a Creature that is not a Player reaches 0 Hit Points they do not Trust Fate, they simply perish, or if the Player or Creature who struck the killing blow decides they would like to non-lethally attack the Creature it is knocked unconscious instead. This functions identically to Hit Points for Players.

LEVEL (PLAYER’S SIDE):

represents generally how powerful a Creature is. The Higher the [[2 CORE RULES#LEVEL|Level]] the more powerful the Creature is. [[2 CORE RULES#LEVEL|Level]] is also the innate Modifier for Attacks, Defenses, Armor Value, Damage, and Skills, barring any additional equipment or Abilities that could be enhancing one of those statistics. This functions Identically to [[2 CORE RULES#LEVEL|Level]] for Players.

SIZE (PLAYER’S SIDE):

represents a Creature’s Size. Size can be from 0-5, increasing how large the Creature is. Sizes 0 - 1 take up only 1 Tile, while Sizes 2-5 take up their Size value squared in Tiles. Size also determines the Creature's Reach, or how many Tiles (the Size Value equals the number of Tiles) from the edge of their own that they can touch or grab with their natural limbs. This functions Identically to Size for Players.

          SPEED (PLAYER’S SIDE):

represents how much a Creature can move in Tiles on its Turn. Some Creatures will also have Non-Standard Movements such as Flight, Swim, or Climb Speeds, that apply only in those circumstances. This functions Identically to Speed for Players.

          TIER OF POWER (PLAYER’S SIDE):

Like [[2 CORE RULES#LEVEL|Level]], Tier of Power is a way to determine generally how powerful a Creature is. Tier of power can determine the strength of a Creature's Abilities as well as how many additional Targets it can Cleave/Ranged Cleave. This functions identically to Tier of Power for Players.

## WEAVER’S SIDE:

CREATURE TYPE (WEAVER’S SIDE):

Informs the Weaver of the Creature’s Creature Type. Certain Abilities or effects may be used or have enhanced effects against Creatures of  particular Creature Type.

DISPOSITION/ SOCIAL APPROVAL/AVERSION (WEAVER’S SIDE):

represents a Creature's amiability or hostility towards the Players. This functions identically to Disposition for Players.

ENVIRONMENT (WEAVER’S SIDE):

represents one or more Environments in which a Creature might be typically found in.

RESISTANCES (WEAVER’S SIDE):

represents any special Resistance a Creature has to particular Damage Typings. Resistance is always a +2 Armor Value against the Resisted Damage Type. This functions identically to Resistance for Players.

SKILLS (WEAVER’S SIDE):

represents a Creature's skill and knowledge. The Value for a Creature's Skills is shown next to the Skills Title. This is a Passive Value for all of the Creature’s Skills. If a particular Skill has any additional modifiers it will be written as (+x) to that Skill in the list.

SUB TYPE (WEAVER’S SIDE):

Some Creatures are fusions or have the properties of  more than one type of Creature.

TACTICS/DESCRIPTION (WEAVER’S SIDE):

represents what the typical strategies, motivations, and wants of the Creature are. This is useful for Weavers as it informs them how they may typically act in combat or in general.

VULNERABILITIES (WEAVER’S SIDE):

represents any special weaknesses a Creature may have to particular Damage Typings. The Creature has a -2 Armor value to any Damage Type that it is Vulnerable to. This functions identically to Vulnerability for Players.

## COMBAT RULES ANCILLARY B: PLAYER VS PLAYER

Occasionally, instances may occur in which Players need to roll or fight against each other. In these scenarios decide beforehand as a group between the Weavers and Players what is comfortable for everyone as Player VS Player scenarios do take away autonomy.  If everyone, Weavers and Players, are comfortable with Player VS Player combat and opposing Skill Rolls, then the Weaver can decide to either have both Players roll dice for all of their actions and defenses or choose to have the defending player use Passive Defenses. For example, in the first scenario, Player A rolls an Attack Roll and Player B, the defending Player, rolls a Defense Roll, ties are re-rolled, since in Player VS Player both Players cannot meet the value to succeed a roll. In the second scenario, using Passive Defenses, Player A, the attacker, simply tries to beat the value of Player B, the defender’s Defense’s Value +5. Like before in the case of a tie, re-roll the attack.

To re-iterate, Player vs Player combat and Skill Rolls can be fun, but at its core Kismet is a cooperative game built around all people playing having fun. Player VS Player scenarios can quickly escalate into frustrating situation for everyone in the game. The Weaver has the final say on when Player vs Player combat or Skill Rolls should stop.
