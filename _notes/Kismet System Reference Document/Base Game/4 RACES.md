There are many Races you can play as in Kismet. Choose one of the Races to be your Character, feel free to read their lore and culture, ask yourself if you feel you want your Character to agree or disagree with the common cultures and why that might be. Anything found in this section is solely for world building and as both a Player and a Weaver you have free reign to change any theme to fit your desired world and Character. 

Once you have chosen what Race you would like your Character to be, record its Unique Racial Abilities and Common Abilities.

While reading the Races section you will see sections that described typical cultural associations of that race. Your Character is by no means restricted to what is listed in these sections, these are simply norms found in that races culture in the base Kismet setting of Amarant.  Feel free to be different, unique, and individual, perhaps your difference puts your Character at odds with the community or maybe even makes them stand out, both make for wonderful Characters!

## HALF-RACES

Half Races can come in any form and combination and are great for role playing and for becoming a part of the world of Amarant. Half Races have no particular mechanical differences from a playing a singularly Raced Character.


## OVERVIEW  

THIS IS A PLACE HOLDER


## HIGH ELVES

**physical description:** High Elves share a slender, frail physical. Their muscles are ropey and not well defined. Most High Elves stand around the same height as humans, around 5 to 6 feet tall. In addition, all High Elves have slightly elongated ears with pointed tips. High Elves (or Vitaviris in high Elven speech, or Tivdasti in all-elven) have skin that ranges from pale white to light yellows. Their hair ranges from blondes, light browns and very rarely black. 

Mental description:** High Elves are the most logical of all races. They excel at a variety of academic skills such as math, science, language and poetry. High Elves respect practical intelligence but hold logic and abstract intelligence in the highest regard. 

**Social description:** Other races often find High Elves difficult and awkward to  communicate with as High Elves tend to favor logic over emotion. This is not to say that they do not have emotions, but rather that  they choose to suppress them where they aren't necessary. This leads to High Elves missing various social cues while conversing with other races. High Elves use little to no body language or tonal changes in their speech. 

**Attire:** High Elves tend to dress in light colors and pastels. When it comes to clothing they have a flair for the dramatic, often sporting orante hats, dresses, collars and robes. Their fashion style ranges widely for individual High Elves but all of their clothing can be described as lavish and over the top. High Elves try to over dress for any occasion. Fashion is considered a high art in High Elvish society and is often the way High Elves express themselves emotionally or indicate to others what they are feeling.  

**Food (diet restrictions, specialities):** High Elves can be very picky eaters. They consider many foods unclean based on their academic culinary knowledge and avoid those foods where they can. They tend towards vegetarian or vegan diets however are not opposed to eating lean meat that has been prepared cleanly.

**Typical Character attributes (humane, logical etc...):** High Elves tend to be Logical, Principled and Ambitious. High Elves are rarely Rebellious, Cruel, or  Naive. 

**Language:** High Elven language is based on Latin, and is a very structured and precise language. High Elves make it a point to learn multiple languages in order to have more access to knowledge. 

**Core life philosophy:** All High Elves have an insatiable thirst for knowledge. They have naturally curious minds and find themselves questioning everything. High Elves believe that their purpose in life is to discover and document everything in the universe and find meaning in understanding the world around them.  

**Castes, professions, daily life, marriage/sex and sexuality:** Outside of the monarchy, the most respected professions in High Elf society are university professeors and scientists. Educators of all kinds are held in high regards. Most Elves spend their days in part in study and in part as artisans or craftsmen. High Elves live in the society ruled by a rule known as the Mordius. The Mordius restricts the total number of people (including tourists, exchange students, and citizens) allowed to exist in Silvestrii at any given time. The Mordius is Enforced by the Iudex Animus, an Elf chosen to rule over High Elves and all their policies. The Iudex determines the number of different professions and skills needed to maintain the Mordius and all the roles needed to keep Silvestrii running at peak efficiency. The Mordius also restricts High Elves from having children without getting permission from the Iudex Animus. Due to this marriage is not for procreation as it is in other races, but as companionship in their studies. Marriage in High Elven society is not celebrated by large ceremonies or reception. High Elven marriage tends to be very personal and intimate, often with just the couple and an officiant being at the wedding. 

**Major religion:** High Elves are the only race that do not actively worship any particular deity. High Elves worship ideals and philosophies rather than named beings. For example a High Elven would worship healing and life, rather than Adonna, a goddess that has influence over those spheres.  

**Planet/realm and palace in Amarant:** High Elves come from the planet Silverstrii, that was in many ways similar to Amarant, albeit a lot smaller. Their planet Silvestrii has a variety of ecosystems, flora and fauna. High Elves call their large island in Amarant Silverstrii as well in order to pay homage to their old realm. The Island of Silvestrii is marked by low plains with a few small mountains. Large cliffs lead to the seas surrounding the Island with little to no beaches. 

 **Special days or time of year:** High Elves celebrate the anniversary of major academic breakthroughs and military victories as holidays throughout their year. Most of these holidays are celebrated by resting their minds from the constant study in their lives. 

**Funeral rites and what does the after life mean if there is one:** High Elves dont believe in a traditional afterlife. Deceased High Elves bodies are often donated to medicine or sciences. If a High Elf body is diseased or is considered unfit for study, it is repurposed to the study of necromancy. High Elves are the only race that dont inherently find the practice of necromancy evil andis considered a valuable craft as it saves resources and labour for more manual tasks allowing High Elves to further focus on their studies. 

**Daily Practice or common prayers, and what do places of worship look like:**

**Creation myth:** High Elves dont share a creation myth like the other races do. High Elves believe that they were the first of the sentient races, having kept meticulous records of their history and past. High Elves, having always been driven towards knowledge and truth have long searched for their origins in the universe. While evolution is the prevailing theory there are some High Elves who have found evidence of a divine origin which then turned into an evolution. 

**Superstitions:** High Elves dont have many superstitions as they are driven to logic and understanding any events they dont understand. However most High Elves are educated enough to have an general understanding of each races history and customs.

**Government (monarchy, republic etc..):** High Elves are ruled by an elected official known as the Iudex Animus, The Iudex is voted on by top professors in the universities as well as the masters of war, economics, and trade. These masters are collectively known as the High Council. The Iudex rules with complete control over all aspects of the country from military to trade to education. Iudex’s rule until they feel or the High Council believe that the Iudex is no longer fit to rule. The most recent Iudex Animus, Aurelius Rex, has recently been found by other world leaders as an undead lich. This has caused a lot of tension between High Elves and other races however High Elves see no issue with it, Aurelius took to lichdom so that he may tirelessly serve his country and people without need of food or sleep for himself. Aurelius is a powerful mage who is slow to anger and quick to take the advice of his High Council. 

**Trade exports and imports:** High Elves take advantage of the temperate climate to cultivate all manner of foods, wine and cheeses. The geography of Silverstrii allows for grazing animals such as sheep and cattle to thrive and the gentle winters allows farms to thrive. High Elves prefer to be self-sufficient rather than relying on trade with other countries but they still trade as needed. 

 **Military (types of troops, what they are known for):** High Elves find martial traditions an inefficient way to wage war, often preferring to use Esteoric magic or powerful psychic energy to fight. They are well known for their brilliant strategies and communication strategies in war. When they do have to fight in close quarters, they prefer lighter, more elegant weapons such as swords and spears. Much like their clothing their weapons and foci are highly decorated and ornate. High Elves prefer to be unencumbered by heavier armor or shields, relying on their skill and wit in battle for protection.

**Relation with core races (Elves, Humans, Seelie, Orcs, Draconians, Undead):**  High Elves are unique amongst the races of Amaranth in that they are neutral towards most races and customs. They get along well enough with everyone to trade, but few would call them allies. Other races find sustained relations with high Elves difficult due to the High Elves awkwardness in social situations, making it rare to know a High Elf as anything other than an acquaintance. This is not to say that High Elves cant make close friendships, but it requires the High Elf to become more attuned to their emotions and the emotions of others. At their best, other races find High Elves to be efficient, and educated and to be treated with great respect for their knowledge and trade. At their worst, High Elves are seen by the other races as evil wizards for their nonchalant attitudes towards Necromancy. Particularly for Dire Orcs and Bindadamu who hold their Ancestors in high regard. 

**Racial Relations** common sayings about the races by other races and maybe racial slurs if we want to go there. 

**Special racial factions** 

**Favored** weapons, armor, elements, sphere of influence etc…: 

**Notable members** ? Would probably just be monarchs




## CHARACTER’S DEFENSES

 Once your Race is chosen, choose three defenses, not including Combat Defense[[Bk1]](#_msocom_1) , for your Character to be Proficient in, those three alongside Combat Defense (which Player Characters are always Proficient in) are your Character’s Proficient Defenses (remember that Proficient means you use your Characters level as the modifier for that statistic, for any statistic you are not Proficient in add only half of that Character’s level rounded down (minimum 0.). Any Defenses not chosen the Character is not Proficient with. See the List of Defenses in Chapter 2 Statistics: Defenses for a comprehensive list.
